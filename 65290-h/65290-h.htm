<small>A KINDLY DEED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">&#8220;LOOK out! Oh, look out, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the man senseless?&#8221; cried a second
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way, sir&mdash;this way&mdash;quick! Dear me!
Are you hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>The school-girl who had uttered the first exclamation
darted suddenly forward into the midst
of the crowd, and pulled from under the very
hoofs of the horses, attached to a heavy dray,
the queer little old gentleman who had occasioned
her outcry.</p>

<p>Every New Yorker knows how thronged is
that particular point, at the southwestern corner
of pretty Madison Square, where Broadway, Fifth
Avenue, and Twenty-third Street&mdash;all favorite
thoroughfares of the shoppers&mdash;meet to shake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
hands, as it were; while each adds its complement
of humanity on foot and humanity in
vehicles to swell the current eddying about the
corner.</p>

<p>A gay and lively place it was, on that early
afternoon. All the curbstone merchants had
come out with their mechanical toys, forever
getting under the pedestrians&#8217; feet, tripping
them up, and threatening more than one with
mischance.</p>

<p>Among such was an old gentleman whose dress
was quaint and out of style, while his manner
was that of one unused to scenes of confusion.
For some moments he had stood upon the sidewalk,
watching with curious interest what went
on about him; but when a papier-mach&eacute; monkey
gave a realistic spring from the end of an elastic
cord, and clasped his ankle, he stepped boldly
forth into the whirlpool of wheels. For half the
short distance between curbs all went well; then
he slipped upon the slimy pavement, and just
where hoofs and wheels were in most hopeless
tangle, he fell.</p>

<p>There was an outcry of horror from many
throats.</p>

<p>The policeman piloting a party of women over
the crossing turned hurriedly, just in time to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
what had happened, as well as a slim girlish
figure spring to the rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! That&#8217;s dangerous! Why should two
be killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were groans and execrations from the
drivers of carts and carriages, the swiftly forming
blockade which follows any break in the
routine of city transit, and the patrolman was
back, seizing the old man&#8217;s shoulder and demanding
why he should make so much more
disturbance than was necessary by tumbling
down in that ridiculous manner. Or if the
policeman did not put his inquiry in just those
words he made it distinctly evident to Mr. Philipse
Chidly Brook that visitors who could not
conduct themselves any better than he had done
might likely find themselves at the station-house,
to be cared for at the public expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come this way with me, will you? Come
this way just for a moment!&#8221; cried the old gentleman,
and seized upon Bonny&#8217;s hand so forcibly
that, whether she would or no, she had to follow
where he led. This was into the flower-shop
close by, and she obeyed readily enough, after all;
for she loved an adventure dearly and therefore&mdash;so
her sister declared&mdash;was always meeting
with one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Isabelle, who had been with her all along, now
interposed: &#8220;Bonny! What are you doing?
You must not go anywhere with a stranger.
Come away at once!&#8221; and she laid her hand
in firm remonstrance upon thoughtless Beatrice&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Belle; directly. But I must see if he
is hurt. Come along, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly; come along, too,&#8221; repeated
Mr. Brook, turning toward the elder miss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. It is impossible. Come,
Bonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>But fun-loving Bonny had already followed the
man into the shop; where, with a smile of gratitude
upon his very muddy face, he asked: &#8220;Who
are you, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no matter about that, sir. Are you
hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, I think. Time will tell. I might
have some cracked bones about my anatomy
somewhere, and yet not know it, amid all this
whirl and racket. Five-and-twenty years since
I set foot in the streets of New York before, and
I find them greatly changed. But I must know
your name, please. I must know to whom I am
indebted for my life. I should have been killed
but for your courage, my dear; or have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
arrested and sent to the lock-up, than which I
would almost think death preferable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny! Bonny Beckwith! Come at once!
Mother would be very much displeased! The
idea of your following a stranger about in this
way!&#8221; cried Belle, now opening the door of the
shop, and looking threateningly at her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Directly, dear. Now, sir, can you tell me
where you are stopping? If you are such a
stranger here, I should think you would better
take a carriage to your home&mdash;or hotel. After
twenty-five years the town must seem like a new
world to you, or, I mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I serve you, miss?&#8221; asked a clerk, coming
forward, and Miss Beatrice interpreted his
tone to mean: &#8220;If I can I wish to do so at once.
If I cannot I would like to have the store vacated.
This is no rendezvous for adventurers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I need nothing,&#8221; said Bonny, and moved
to the door, nodding her head brightly toward
her old gentleman, but casting rather wistful
glances at the counters full of beautiful blossoms
as she passed them on her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment! Wait a moment, my dear!
I have heard your name, you see. Your sister
spoke it. Here is my card; and if you will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
tell me where you live that I may call and thank
you, at least let me give you a posy before we
part. Pick out what you like. Pick out what
you like, my dear, and I will pay for it. Here
is my card,&mdash;Philipse Chidly Brook, New Windsor,
New York. Everybody thereabouts knows
me, as everybody hereabouts used to know me
half a century ago,</p>

<p>
&#8216;When I was young as you are young,<br />
And love-lights in the casement hung.&#8217;&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p>Bonny dropped her hand from the door-knob.
&#8220;Why, that is Thackeray, sir! So you know
him, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice Beckwith! Will you&mdash;or will you
not&mdash;come? I&mdash;am&mdash;going!&#8221; cried the indignant
Isabelle, moving slowly away from her
ill-conducted little sister. She was greatly shocked
and mortified by Bonny&#8217;s readiness to take up
with anything and anybody, and was quite justified
in her feeling; for in most cases there is
danger in any girl following a stranger, for even
so slight a distance as Bonny had done, in a great
city like New York.</p>

<p>But this time she happened to be safe enough.
Old Chidly Brook was a gentleman if ever one
lived; and queer and quaint as he now appeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
time had been when he was a great favorite even
in the most exclusive circles of New York&#8217;s best
society.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, my age is sufficient guaranty of
my honor. Do allow me to give you a little
bouquet of some sort. No? Then&mdash;have you
a mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I have a dear, dear mother, who
will be troubled if I stay from home longer.
Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her name? Her number? I must be allowed
to call and pay her my respects!&#8221; In
his eagerness, which was almost childish, the
old man laid his thin hand upon Bonny&#8217;s
wrist.</p>

<p>She glanced down upon it; its delicacy and
refinement appealed to her; she longed to know
more of its owner, and replied: &#8220;My mother is
Mrs. Rachel Beckwith, Number Blank, Second
Avenue.&#8221; Then she darted out of the shop and
tried to look defiantly into the vexed face of her
pretty sister Belle.</p>

<p>But it was of no use. The defiance faded soon,
and a whimsical humility took its place. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry, I&#8217;m awfully sorry, dear, that I didn&#8217;t
mind you. I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t let the dear old
fellow lie there to be hurt. I&mdash; No, I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
mean that. But I&#8217;ll try to behave next time.
I truly will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m!&#8221; replied Isabelle; and vouchsafed
nothing further till they had reached their home,
a cosey if small and plainly furnished &#8220;flat&#8221; at the
location which Bonny had given Mr. Brook.</p>

<p>That old gentleman, left in the flower-store
after his young rescuer had departed, turned at
once to the clerk. &#8220;I saw the child cast her
eyes rather longingly, I thought, upon that vase
of salmon-colored artemisias. Are they for sale?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied the attendant, and moved
the vase forward upon the counter. &#8220;They are
the same thing as artemisias, sir, but the popular
name is chrysanthemum. These are prize flowers,
from the late show. A rare color. One of our
own originating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m, h&#8217;m-m. Very pretty, but roses suit
me better. However, she looked at these more
than she did at the roses and pinks, and I&#8217;ll take
them. How much are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventy-five cents each.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;W-h-a-t? How&mdash;much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventy-five cents each. Chrysanthemums
are the fashionable flower now. All the people
at the horse-show&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I came into town to see.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Thinks I to myself, Old fellow, brace up yourself
a bit and take one more look at life before
you step behind the curtain. A great town,
young man, and full of pitfalls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; respectfully. &#8220;Will you take more
than one of the blooms, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than one! What do you think of me,
lad? If you were going to send a posy to a
pretty little girl, would you send her a pitiful,
solitary blossom? If you would you ought to
be ashamed of yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>The salesman laughed pleasantly, and awaited
directions, which came promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pick me out the prettiest and biggest basket
you have in the shop. Then fill it with these
artemisias&mdash;if there are enough. If not, finish
out with white ones. She looked just like a
pretty pink and white blossom herself, with her
rosy cheeks and white teeth. And what eyes
she had&mdash;did she not? Yes, yes; a big basket
of posies is a small price to pay for old bones
saved from breaking! It must be of the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How will this please you?&#8221; asked the attendant,
showing a pretty willow affair, shaped like
the baskets seen in old-fashioned &#8220;Annuals&#8221; as
held by the hands of high-coiffured dames with
sloping shoulders and simpering mouths.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Mr. Chidly Brook was charmed directly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it! That is just the very thing!
Some of the good old notions have survived
these silly later fashions, then? Glad to hear
it! I am exceedingly glad to hear it. Now,
young man, will you lend me a pen and paper,
if you have such a thing handy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Will you, please, step to the
desk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to write a little note, you know. A sort
of <i>billet-doux</i>, as we called them in the old days.
I was a hand&mdash;I was a master hand at writing
<i>billet-doux</i> then. Let me see. Number Blank,
Second Avenue. A most aristocratic neighborhood,
is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;sir&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. It might be.
It was once, they say. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough. I hate these eternal &#8216;was onces&#8217;!
No matter. What will do for a home for that
little girl must be a pretty sort of place any
way. On our farm, my uncle&#8217;s, it was just
above that grand street of millionaire residents&mdash; Fourteenth&mdash; What
are you staring at, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. Nothing whatever, beg pardon.
But you must have known New York for many
years. Fourteenth Street is now a synonym for
a street of cheap lodging-houses and such; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
is, the resident portion. The business part is fine
enough. It will take about forty-three or five
chrysanthemums to fill this basket. But we
have smaller ones, sir, of the same shape. Will
you look at them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said the biggest. I didn&#8217;t mean the smallest.
Thank Heaven, Philipse Chidly Brook is
still able to pay for a decent basket of posies for
his little lady, I should hope! Thank you. I
will have the note written by the time the basket
is filled. And I wish to have especial care used
in the delivery of the same. The <i>billet-doux</i> is
important. I would not have it lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall not be. But the filling of the basket
will take some time, a half-hour at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. I am not pressed for time. Yet.
I will wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did wait, with what those better acquainted
with him would have considered an unusual
amount of patience; but the truth was that
the old fellow had had a pretty severe shaking-up,
and now that his excitement over the
accident began to ebb, he was more and more
conscious of pains and bruises.</p>

<p>Finally, when the basket, perfect in its beauty,
was tendered for his inspection, he rose very
stiffly and barely looked at it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Here is the bill, sir. Forty-three chrysanthemums
at seventy-five cents, thirty-two dollars,
twenty-five cents; one basket, five&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The amount, lad! The amount! I hate
detail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty-nine dollars, twenty-five cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Two twenty-dollar pieces. Keep
the change and buy one posy for your girl!&#8221;
And with this fine sarcasm, as he considered it,
the old gentleman left the flower-shop, entered
the cab which a cash-boy had called for him,
and gave the direction: &#8220;Astor House. At
once.&#8221;</p>

<small>PINK PETALS AND BRIGHT VISIONS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YES, Mother; if you cannot persuade Beatrice
to behave herself upon the street, I
really think she should not be allowed to go out.
Her goings on are very mortifying to me, and
she is sure to get us into some dreadful sort of
scrape yet, worse than that small-pox scare last
week&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweet maiden, all severe! Don&#8217;t! That is
a sensitive point with your unfortunate sister!
The less said upon it the more agreeable!&#8221; interrupted
Bonny, skipping across the narrow parlor
of the Beckwith home, whither they had just returned,
and catching the tall Isabelle around the
waist with a persuasive little hug.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been doing now, Beatrice?&#8221;
asked the gentle little widow, looking up from a
piece of wonderful embroidery, and fixing a half-amused,
half-apprehensive gaze upon the younger
girl&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, dear Motherkin, but a simple act of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
charity. I happened to see a funny old gentleman
tumble down in the middle of the street, and
I pulled him out of harm&#8217;s way. Isn&#8217;t that a
right sort of thing to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is only the beginning,&#8221; added Belle.
&#8220;She was not contented with a really kind and
brave rescue, but she must go off with her prot&eacute;g&eacute;
into a store and tell him all about ourselves,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isabelle! Not &#8216;all.&#8217; I merely told him where
we lived. And it was really an act of charity to
ourselves. He will make a delightful and very
salable model for Motherkin&#8217;s embroidery. Lend
me your pencil, dear. Let me show you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice, have you done this foolish thing?
Did you go with any stranger into a shop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t interrupt the flow of art, Motherkin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you did, you must never do so again.
Leave the person you have assisted to go his way
and you go yours. And of all people to get into
such affairs you are certainly the most unfortunate
child I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to be good, Mother dear. Only it
will be very difficult. He was a nice old man.
This looks very like him. You must do his legs
in burnt sienna. See? And his coat&mdash;his coat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
was like a &#8216;picter.&#8217; All tight down the back and
very high-shouldered as to sleeves, which also
were very long and narrow. Do his coat in
Prussian blue. His &#8216;weskit&#8217; was yellow ochre,
touched up with umber; and his hat&mdash;alas! his
hat had disappeared! His face&mdash;Motherkin, he
had a nice face. A good face, a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the tramp you let into the house, while
we were out, to steal our last half-dozen silver
spoons! He, I remember, &#8216;had a good face, a
really intellectual face&#8217;!&#8221; remarked Belle, gibingly.
Her good nature was now quite restored
by the pleasure of finding some excuse for teasing
Beatrice, who liked to tease them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Motherkin! Isn&#8217;t that &#8216;sweetly pretty&#8217;?
Can you not work him into a landscape of trees
and cows and clouds and other country things?&#8221;
demanded Bonny, ignoring her sister, and laying
the really clever little sketch in her mother&#8217;s
lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you get on with your singing, dear?&#8221;
asked that lady, smiling, and taking time from
her work to pat the soft cheek of her merry
daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Badly. There is a terrible discrepancy between
my chest notes and my head notes. When
T try to stretch one up and the other down, something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
appears to give way&mdash;cr-r-rick-crac-c-k-screech!
Shall I illustrate, Mother dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I beg! My nerves are in bad condition
to-day. But if you&#8217;ll sing something without
nonsense, I shall be glad to hear you. It
would rest me, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice&#8217;s gay face sobered instantly, and Isabelle
laid down her book. &#8220;Are you so tired,
Motherkin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no, indeed! Only it is a bit monotonous
stitching, stitching all day with nobody to talk
to. Never mind. Here comes Roland. I wonder
why so early.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inquiry was in her eyes as she raised them
to meet her son&#8217;s when he entered, full three
hours before his usual time of home-coming. But
she saw instantly that he was not ill, and, that
anxiety allayed, she smiled brightly upon him.
&#8220;Well, my boy! what good fortune has given
you a holiday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill, not good fortune, Mother. I&mdash;I have
been discharged. I have lost my place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, indeed, did a significant silence fall upon
the family group. Lost his place! Could anything
have been more unfortunate!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, &#8216;Laureate,&#8217; have you been writing
more soap-poetry?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;No, Bonny; but I had a row with the boss,
and he talked to me so rudely that I made up my
mind no gentleman would stand it. So I bolted.
That&#8217;s all. I was going to leave, anyway, after
the holidays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you were, eh? Going into soap-poetry
for a business? If it pays as well as your first
venture&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear. But I&#8217;ll just make a note of
your new words. You will have quite a vocabulary
if you keep on. &#8216;Row,&#8217; &#8216;boss,&#8217; &#8216;bolted,&#8217; will
rhyme admirably with &#8216;cow,&#8217; &#8216;toss,&#8217; &#8216;moulted.&#8217; I
shall take to writing for soap-prizes myself soon.
I&#8217;ve always had a notion that my genius would
develop in a direction not at present suspected by
my family. Mother thinks I am an embryo
prima-donna; Belle knows I am a fine dressmaker;
Bob is sure I was born for no other purpose
than to make boys&#8217; kites, and Roland must
acknowledge he never would have won the soap-poem
prize if I hadn&#8217;t furnished at least one missing
rhyme. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny, do keep still! If I were as fond of
talking as you, I&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk! Hark! There goes the door-bell. I
hope nobody has come to call, for&mdash;&#8221; The chatterbox<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
did not wait to express her inhospitable
reasons, but darted down the narrow passage to
answer the summons, and was back almost
directly, bearing in her arms the basket of chrysanthemums
which Mr. Brook&#8217;s messenger had
just brought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; cried the delighted girl, dancing
about so that nobody could get more than a glance
at her burden of lovely blossoms, until she finally
dropped in a little heap at her mother&#8217;s feet and
placed the basket on the drawing she had laid
upon her mother&#8217;s knee. &#8220;Such a handy table
your lap makes, Motherkin!&#8221; she often remarked;
but the truth was that everything must be shared
with this sympathizing woman or it lost in value.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it lovely, lovely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovely, indeed! But it cannot possibly be
meant for you, dear. Where did it come from?
How did you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is meant for me. It came from
the store I visited in company with my old gentleman.
And I took it out of a messenger boy&#8217;s
hand. Oh! the beauties! the darlings! Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Miss Isabelle Beckwith, don&#8217;t you wish you had
not been so impatient? Maybe his royal highness&mdash;he
must be that, at least, or he couldn&#8217;t
afford such a gift&mdash;would have sent you one wee
blossom all for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do not understand. I do not know
that it is right for you to keep it, dear,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Beckwith, between the rapid exclamations
which fell from the lips of all three
young people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Motherkin! Of course it&#8217;s right! It&#8217;s
the very prettiest compliment I ever had in all
my life. Don&#8217;t go for to spoil it with your proper
notions, that&#8217;s a good Mother! But&mdash;see here!
Here&#8217;s a <i>billet-doux</i>! or I&#8217;m a sinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>If Mr. Philipse Chidly Brook could have witnessed
the delight with which his offering was
received, and could have heard the running comments
bestowed upon it, he would have been
repaid a thousand times. For when his courtly
little note, with its old-fashioned writing, was
read aloud, even the careful mother had no
further reproof for her adventure-loving Beatrice,
not all whose chivalrous escapades ended as comfortably
as this.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Fair, Kind, and Most Respected Miss</span>,&mdash;Allow

<span class="smcap">Philipse Chidly Brook</span>.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">New Windsor</span>, N. Y., <i>November Twenty-third, Eighteen
hundred and eighty-one</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;My obedient servant! My blessed old Prince
of Givers! That&#8217;s what he should have signed.
Seventy-five cents each, Motherkin mine! All
lavished on your troublesome girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith did not immediately reply. She
took the note from Bonny&#8217;s hand and gazed at it
musingly, as if trying to clear some confusion
of memory. &#8220;I have heard that name before&mdash;somewhere&mdash;besides
in history. Let me
think!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will hear it again&mdash;&#8216;somewhere&#8217;!
Here comes my &#8216;Humpty-Dumpty&#8217;! I was wishing
he could enjoy this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Bon! What the dickens is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Bob! It&#8217;s chrysanthemums, not
dickens!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;Stuff! That can&#8217;t be yours! Where did you
get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can be mine, it shall be mine, it is mine.
It is a reward of merit, the first instalment of
many I hope to receive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell a feller!&#8221; pleaded the eight-year-old boy,
who was very like Beatrice, only that his hair was
a little rougher, his dark eyes even brighter, his
general appearance a trifle more dilapidated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told a &#8216;feller,&#8217; and if a &#8216;feller&#8217; can&#8217;t
believe I am not to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother! Tell the hull concern!&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice slipped her arm around the little chap
as affectionately as if his costume were not plentifully
bedaubed with street mud, and kissed his
retrouss&eacute; nose squarely on its tip; after which
she gave him a history of the afternoon&#8217;s incident,
told as only Bonny would have told it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jimminy-cracky! He must be richer&#8217;n
thunder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert! Where do you learn such talk?
Why will you use such words?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno, Mother. They seem to grow somehow.
Say, Bon! That basket is worth a heap
of money!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother, you should not look a gift horse
in the mouth!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re doing it yourself, aren&#8217;t you? I saw
you counting all the time you were talking. So
was I. But some of &#8217;em seemed to get away. I
bet they is more&#8217;n forty. S&#8217;pose they cost much
as five cents apiece?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five cents! Seventy-five is the price of that
particular shade everywhere. Think of it! Do
it,&mdash;a nice little sum for a nice little boy for a
nice little girl who pulled a nice little man out
of a nice little crowd on a nice little corner of a
nice&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny, Bonny! Don&#8217;t be silly! But, indeed,
I don&#8217;t wonder! The sight of so much
beauty has raised my own spirits till I feel able
to fight the world afresh&mdash;for you, my children!
But Bonny is right; don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t &#8216;count the teeth&#8217;
of this lovely &#8216;gift horse,&#8217; dears. Put the basket
on that white cloth I just finished embroidering,
right in the centre of the table. Then let us
gather about it and study it. We will all work
the better for the lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Motherkin! you are the dearest, wisest
body in the world. Here&#8217;s your chair&mdash;right
up front. And say! let&#8217;s every one tell what
she or he sees in the flowers. I suppose that
present represents something different to each;
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;I suppose with all your practical sense you
are still a fanciful child!&#8221; responded Mrs. Beckwith,
smiling fondly upon the active Beatrice,
who was, indeed, her mother&#8217;s &#8220;right hand&#8221; of
dependence in their every-day life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I am, I think it is a case of heredity&mdash;like
I was reading about in last night&#8217;s paper.
When you were left to make faces at fortune,
with four troublesome youngsters pulling at your
skirts, you might have dropped your mouth-corners
and put on a doleful expression&mdash;but
you did not. You just rolled up your sleeves
and put on your thimble and shut your eyes
to the old dame&#8217;s frowns and went to work. I
remember, Motherkin, once when &#8216;Humpty-Dumpty&#8217;
was in the cradle, and I was rocking
him to sleep, you sang so loud and so long that
I told you I wouldn&#8217;t rock him any more if you
didn&#8217;t keep still; and you turned on me with
such a look! Your eyes were full of tears and
your lips were trembling; but yet you were
smiling as brave as could be. &#8216;I dare not stop,
darling!&#8217; you said; &#8216;if I did I should cry!&#8217; I
tell you, Motherkin, I never forgot that, and I
never will! But what do you see in the &#8216;posy,&#8217;
dear Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see an old-fashioned garden, with an old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
dame walking in it. An old-fashioned
gentleman is bending before her, and presenting
her with chrysanthemums&mdash;of just this shade.
It is early winter&mdash;or late, late fall. There is
hoar-frost on the dead leaves in the path, hoar-frost
upon the hair of these two people, and a
touch of winter&#8217;s cold has nipped their thin
cheeks. Yet they smile and are lovingly courteous
still. They know that the chrysanthemums
will fade; that the hoar-frost will change to ice
on which they must slip downwards over the
dead-leaf path&mdash;out of sight. But they will be
brave and beautiful to the end; and their memory
will be like the strange and spicy fragrance of
their chosen flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how pretty, Mother! Call the picture
&#8216;Artemisias.&#8217; That is the old-time name for
&#8216;Mums.&#8217; And I hope when it is done some rich,
rich person who has leisure to study the meaning
of beautiful things will buy your drapery
and hang it on a wall alone, close to a cheery
wood fire; and that he will sit down before it
many times and learn all that you have put
into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle, next! What says the basket to you,
Miss Beauty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see a big, big ball-room. It is filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
handsome women and gentlemanly men. They
are all, like Bonny&#8217;s &#8216;rich one,&#8217; at leisure and at
rest. They say courteous things to one another,
and they feel them. The women have never
known what it means to wear patched shoes and
soiled gloves. They have travelled everywhere.
They know everything that happy mortals need
to know. They have never heard that there was
poverty in the world which they could not relieve,
nor suffering they could not soothe. They have
never had their tempers spoiled and their faces
lined by want of any sort. I am there in the
midst of them, as care-free, as beautiful, as soft-spoken
as any of them. As happy, too. I wear
a lovely gown of just that chrysanthemum shade,
but no jewels. I have the blossoms in my hair,
on my corsage, in my hands. I love them. I
am wholly, wholly content. I have nothing left
to wish for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy mortal! Come, &#8216;Laureate&#8217;! But
cut it short. Because, you know, my poet, you
are inclined to be a little long-drawn-out sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! impious spirit! Fright not the muse
away!&#8221; retorted Roland, in a very unpoetic tone.
&#8220;I am in Japan. There are lovely fountains,
perfect gardens, beautiful maidens&mdash;and lots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
time! I don&#8217;t get up in the morning till I choose.
I write soap or even stove-polish poems, unrebuked
by my irreverent sister. I have plenty of
money to buy my mother gowns covered with
embroidery which she doesn&#8217;t have to do herself,
and to fill the cupboard with food which she
doesn&#8217;t have to cook. There are wonderful kites
which Bonny does not make, but which &#8216;Humpty-Dumpty&#8217;
does fly, from the top of a funny little
house as tall as a table, into a blue sky which
rests on the top of his head&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough! Now, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I dunno. No school, fer one thing.
No grammar talk when I get home. Plenty of
fire-crackers an&#8217; pistols an&#8217; guns an&#8217; turkey an&#8217;
everything I want! Say, Bonny Beckwith! Ain&#8217;t
we never a going to have any supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At once, small sir. It is a matter of economy
to feed you immediately you feel the need of
being fed. The longer the delay the greater the
cavity. Now, dreamers, all move back, please.
Your humble servant has the floor, and must
have the table, seeing that it is the only one the
house of Beckwith possesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a smile they all pushed back; but the
gentle widow laid her hand caressingly upon
Beatrice&#8217;s shoulder with the question: &#8220;Had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
chrysanthemums no visions for your eyes, sweetheart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaps of &#8217;em, Motherkin! But some other
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No fair, no fair, Bon! What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A home in the country!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! I reckon I&#8217;ll get my Japanese tour
first!&#8221; said Roland, as he placed the basket of
flowers upon the top of the sewing-machine amid
a pile of unmended stockings. &#8220;Gracious! How
much depends upon surroundings! That isn&#8217;t
half as suggestive up there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! What&#8217;s that row in the street? Hear
that awful thumping!&#8221; cried Bob, seizing his
hat and bounding down the stairs, two steps at a
time.</p>

<p>Bonny also hurried to the window, but turned
from it in instant dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the goodness&#8217; sake! It&#8217;s my old gentleman,
and a policeman has him by the collar!&#8221;
And before anybody could interpose she had followed
her small brother.</p>

<small>A CHRYSANTHEMUM DINNER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A SECOND time in one day was Bonny Beckwith
destined to come to the rescue of the
unfortunate Mr. Brook; for she laid her hand
appealingly upon the policeman&#8217;s sleeve and
cried: &#8220;Oh, sir! What are you doing? This
gentleman is all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bright-faced girl was no stranger to the
officer, who probably knew all the residents of his
&#8220;beat,&#8221; and he asked, in surprise: &#8220;Why, do
you know him, Miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. He is a friend of ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better give him some lessons in
conducting himself on the street; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
With this the roundsman loosened his hold of his
victim, and flourished his hand to disperse the
crowd of urchins and sight-seers who had gathered
on the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thumped on the door of &mdash;&mdash; as if he were
trying to break it in. Why didn&#8217;t he ring if he
wanted to, instead of creating a disturbance?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;Were you looking for us, Mr. Brook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I was. And I should like to know
how in the world you get into these houses.
There is no bell, and the door-knob won&#8217;t turn,
and I&#8217;d stood here as long as I dared with the
wind blowing forty miles an hour. I sent cabby
off to walk his horses up and down, and he&#8217;s disappeared
entirely. I left my man at the hotel,
in bed with the rheumatism; and&mdash;if there&#8217;s
any way of getting into this prison and if you
really live here, I should like to be admitted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Beg pardon for keeping you so
long. See&mdash;this is the way. Touch one of
those little knobs, the one opposite the card with
&#8216;Beckwith&#8217; on it and the door will open almost
immediately. Electric bells, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unluckily, I didn&#8217;t know! I hate these new-fangled
&#8216;conveniences&#8217; that are ten times as much
trouble as old-fashioned things. I&#8217;m not quite a
fool, my dear, though I may have been presented
to you in that light on both occasions of our meeting.
I simply did not know how to get in; but
I concluded that if I made noise enough somebody
would hear and answer,&#8221; said Mr. Brook,
smiling merrily, now that the door had opened
noiselessly, as if by spirit hands, and a hallway
with orthodox stairs was revealed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;And somebody did!&#8221; returned Bonny, quite
as gayly; while Robert, who had slipped up and
thrown his arm about his sister&#8217;s waist, laughed
outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Who are you, sir? You were one
of the boys who jeered the loudest, if I&#8217;m not
mistaken,&#8221; said the visitor, turning with a savage
frown toward the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m her brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. My brother Robert. He isn&#8217;t as bad as
he looks, Mr. Brook. Perhaps you would better
wait a moment and get your breath. It is pretty
high up&mdash;on the fifth floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious! Is this one of those &#8216;flat&#8217;
houses I hear about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the finest old houses in the city stood
here a quarter of a century ago. It is a shame,
a perfect shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so. There are some beautiful
residences still left in the neighborhood, and we
often look at them and try to imagine the lives
that used to be lived in them. But a fifth-story
flat is all we can afford, so you must prepare
yourself for a plain little place.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had ascended as far as the fourth floor,
and Mr. Brook had paused on each landing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
regain his wind; but Bob, at a nod from Beatrice,
had sped upwards to announce the coming of the
guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! plainness does not disturb me, my dear;
and you are a little gentlewoman, no matter
where you live. I hope I have not chosen an
inopportune hour for my call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have given us all a great, great pleasure
by your beautiful gift which came this afternoon;
and we are glad to have you come and receive our
thanks, whenever it suits you best.&#8221; Bonny did
not add, as she might, that if he had deferred the
call for one hour longer their simple dinner might
have been gotten out of the way, and the home
made ready for his reception.</p>

<p>The first thing that greeted the old gentleman&#8217;s
eyes as he entered the room, which was
dining-room and parlor in one for the Beckwiths,
was his own basket of chrysanthemums replaced
upon the snowy cloth in the centre of the table,
with the soft glow of a shaded lamp falling upon
it. If Mrs. Beckwith had arranged this with a
view to blinding stranger eyes to the bareness of
the room otherwise, her ruse succeeded, for Mr.
Brook gazed upon the flowers and for a space saw
nothing more.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother, Mr. Brook,&#8221; said Bonny, bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
forward the one really strong chair which the
room afforded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your humble servant, madam. I consider
myself honored in making your acquaintance.
You are the mother of a most charming daughter.
Daughters, I should say;&#8221; for at that instant
Isabelle moved gracefully forward, with a friendliness
meant to drive any awkward memories
from the guest&#8217;s mind, and extended her slim
hand in greeting.</p>

<p>At which &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty,&#8221; from a point
behind Mr. Brook&#8217;s back, contorted his freckled
face and rolled his black eyes so horribly that
Bonny was forced to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have much to thank you for, and must
consider that a fortunate accident which resulted
in our receiving so delightful a gift,&#8221; answered
the hostess, placing herself near her visitor,
&#8220;unless your fall of this afternoon resulted
in some injury to yourself. I hope it did
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, oh! no. That is, nothing to mention.
A few bruises and scratches, and a bit of stiffness.
But I thank you. I should not have been
alone, only Dolloway, my man, has the rheumatism
and I couldn&#8217;t think of taking him out in
the cold. He stayed at the hotel. If he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
with me he would have prevented my making an
exhibition of myself. However, &#8216;all&#8217;s well that
ends well;&#8217; and I have been congratulating myself
ever since that I may have been thus led to
trace an old friend. Did you ever hear of one
Conrad Honeychurch Beckwith?&#8221;</p>

<p>A responsive smile illumined the widow&#8217;s pale
face, and the last misgiving she had about thus
receiving a stranger into her home vanished.
&#8220;There could be but one Conrad Honeychurch
Beckwith, I think. Such was the name of my
husband&#8217;s father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so! I thought so! Your husband
is&mdash;was&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles Honeychurch Beckwith. The only
son of Conrad who grew to manhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, your hand again! We are old, old
friends! Or we should be. Conrad was the
chum of my youth, the Damon to my Pythias.
We even went &#8216;Forty-Nining&#8217; together; but he
soon left California and returned to his dying
wife in New York. I stayed&mdash;awhile. He wrote
me a few times, then ceased to even answer my
letters, which after a while I ceased to write.
From that day to this I have never heard of him.
I have hunted Beckwiths without number, till
people have thought me Beckwith mad; but my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Conrad was never among them, and I had given
him up. How strange, how strange, and also
how fortunate, that I stood gaping at the sights
till I was knocked down and Conrad&#8217;s grandchild
was sent to pick me up! Come here, my dear!
Come here and let me look at you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Brook&#8217;s excitement communicated itself
to all the household, always alert to anything
which varied the monotony of their pinched lives.
Roland came forward and gazed wonderingly
upon the man who, fast slipping out of life, yet
remembered so faithfully the friend of his youth.
Belle felt the elation of a real romance; Bonny
was dancing with delight; and Robert, the &#8220;terrible,&#8221;
was eagerly speculating whether this was
the sort of an old gentleman one read of in story-books,
duly appreciative of small attentions and
liberal as to tips.</p>

<p>But the mother understood best the desire of
the old man&#8217;s heart to learn all there was to tell,
and set herself to gratify it. &#8220;My dears, suppose
you go on with the dinner-getting. I am sure
Mr. Brook will pardon our necessity, and I hope
will share our meal. You see, we are rather
cramped for room; so, while table is being made
ready, those of us not engaged in the task
generally retreat to this corner and call it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
&#8216;withdrawing room.&#8217; But maybe you know the
inconveniences of a small city flat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. Thank the Lord, I live in the
country. Even in my best days I would get out
of town nearly every night to sleep at home;
though I was a beau here, when I first came back
from the coast with my pockets full of nuggets.
I used purposely to have my name in the papers
as often as might be, hoping that thus, if I could
not find Conrad, he would find me. But it was
of no use. Five-and-twenty years ago I left the
town for good. I never meant to come back.
But of late a terrible uneasiness has possessed me,
and I finally yielded to it. I understand what it
meant now.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had moved to the corner which Mrs.
Beckwith had designated, and though the guest
appeared to notice nothing of what the young
folks were doing, he was, nevertheless, very
watchful; and while his hostess related all the
simple history of two discouraged men, her husband
and his father, yielding to a fate which
seemed too hard for them and dying, each in his
prime,&mdash;ay, even before what most would call
the prime,&mdash;the wise old visitor read between
her periods the tale of her own bravery, and wondered
how best he could second her efforts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;And that is all. I am sorry we have not
better entertainment to offer, but such as we
have I see is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow rose as she spoke, and it was not
many paces Mr. Brook need follow her before he
reached the table.</p>

<p>With a commendable view to eking out a short
supply, Bonny had placed the basket of flowers
again upon the board, though she had had to
substitute a coarse tablecloth for the daintily
embroidered fabric which was intended for a
richer household; and, at the first glance, the
guest almost believed that the posies were to be
their only repast.</p>

<p>However, this was not the case. There were
roasted potatoes, bread, butter, and a fragrant
cup of tea; the last a luxury, and the one addition
which had been made to the regular fare. Now
tea was an abomination to the palate of Philipse
Chidly Brook, and potatoes he never ate, when
he could help himself; but this being an occasion
when he evidently could not, he put a brave face
on the matter, and accepted them as if they were
the rarest of delicacies. Suddenly he looked up
from his plate, and beheld the dark eyes of Robert
fixed upon him with critical attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my lad! Out with it! A penny for
your thoughts.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>For once the graceless boy was scared. The
prospect of possible tips depended upon his present
behavior, and he choked back the remark that
had almost escaped his lips. &#8220;I&mdash;I haven&#8217;t
any. I&mdash;I mean&mdash;I dassent tell &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for the penny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, not fer a nickel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t. I can guess them. In any
case I never go above the traditional price of
thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet&mdash;you can&#8217;t guess &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much will you bet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert!&#8221; remonstrated Mrs. Beckwith, while
Belle began &#8220;talking eyes&#8221; at her most rapid
rate, certain that the boy was about to disgrace
them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet all I&#8217;ve got. Two cents ag&#8217;in two of
yourn, if you say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Brook, our little brother attends the
primary department of a highly esteemed parish
school. Hence the elegant language which you
must have observed,&#8221; remarked Bonny, hoping to
divert attention from the subject of &#8220;thoughts&#8221;
to education.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is well enough. For a boy. He looks
like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Motherkin says I behave like her, too,&#8221; asserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Bob, triumphantly; and Beatrice felt her
effort worse than wasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. You were wondering how old I am.
Wasn&#8217;t it so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger! How did you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a boy once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you use to do? Did you play
marbles? Er fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I played marbles and I flew kites. When I
could get any money to buy them with, or coax
my mother to make them. And I used to drive
the cows when I visited my uncle, on his farm,
not far from here. It may be that I have trotted
barefooted over the very spot on which this house
now stands. Seventy years ago, that was; seventy
years ago! Then I was a child like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My gracious! An&#8217; you&#8217;re alive yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only that&mdash;I am happy yet! Doubly
happy now that I have found somebody who may
become like a little grandson to me; for I have
none of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably because I never had a wife. I would
like to &#8216;adopt&#8217; my Conrad&#8217;s grandson, in a way,
if he will let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;Pooh! You wouldn&#8217;t want me, I guess.
An&#8217; I know &#8217;bout &#8217;doptingness. They was a
woman in this house, she &#8217;dopted a baby, an&#8217; it
squalled. Nen she got tired of it. Nen she
wanted to give it back an&#8217; the folks wouldn&#8217;t
take it. Nen she put it in the Norphan &#8217;Sylum.
An&#8217; it&#8217;s there yet. I&#8217;m too big, anyway. I&#8217;m
going on nine. Ain&#8217;t I, Mother? When will I
be as old as nine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next Fourth of July, dear. You certainly
are too old for adoption, as you mean it. But if
Mr. Brook hasn&#8217;t any odd, small people to make
him both glad and sorry, all in a minute, you
might supply the deficiency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. I guess I&#8217;d better not. I ain&#8217;t very
good. I don&#8217;t have time to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed? What keeps you busy?&#8221; asked the
amused old gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Folks. An&#8217; fun. Bonny &#8217;most wears me
out, some days. She sends me to do things. I
sell papers; an&#8217; I hold horses, when I can get &#8217;em
to hold. Some men say I ain&#8217;t big &#8217;nough, an&#8217; I
think that&#8217;s mean. I&#8217;m as big as I can be,
ain&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite!&#8221; answered the unwise Beatrice, who
did her daily best to spoil the child by alternate
teasings and pettings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;Nen I get mad. Nen Motherkin&#8217;s heart acts
up. An&#8217; they is a gen&#8217;ral miscomfort in the
house, so I go outdoors. I learn bad words outdoors,
an&#8217; I come home an&#8217; say &#8217;em, an&#8217; get
&#8217;proved. But we get along. Hello, Motherkin!
What&#8217;s the matter? Ginger! There she goes
ag&#8217;in! It&#8217;s one of her sick times, I s&#8217;pose! Oh!
Mother! You&#8217;re dead&mdash;you&#8217;re dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Unobserved by all but her small son, Mrs. Beckwith
had fallen gently forward till her colorless
face rested upon the basket of chrysanthemums,
and the guest thought the boy had spoken the
sorrowful truth.</p>

<small>A GENEROUS CONSPIRACY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;DON&#8217;T, Robert! Remember, it is best to
be quiet!&#8221; said Isabelle, with an admirable
self-control which not only gave Mr. Brook a
new idea of her character, but the knowledge that
this could not be the first time such a trouble had
befallen the household.</p>

<p>And, a moment later, Beatrice had taken time
to whisper in the little fellow&#8217;s ear: &#8220;It is no
worse than usual, darling. Mother is reviving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the child heard a trembling question,
eager and low: &#8220;Has she ever been like this before?
Is it my visit that has caused it?&#8221; and
looking up through his fingers he saw the disturbed
face of their guest bent close above him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. No. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t your visit. She&#8217;s this
way often. But she always looks like dead, an&#8217;
the doctor-man says she will die if she don&#8217;t stop
sewin&#8217; an&#8217; live outdoors. But she can&#8217;t let the
sewin&#8217; go, &#8217;cause we have to eat an&#8217; wear clothes.
We don&#8217;t eat any more&#8217;n we can help, but we&#8217;re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
always hungry. We try not to be, but we are.
So she has to &#8217;broider the things an&#8217; sell &#8217;em,
you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two were quite alone then in the little
parlor, for Roland had, at the first instant, lifted
his mother in his arms and carried her into the
small bedroom which was her own, and had
stationed himself beside her to chafe her face
and hands and administer the medicine which
Isabelle had promptly prepared. They were
evidently accustomed to such emergencies; but
Bonny had disappeared in pursuit of a doctor,
though she knew this action to be against her
mother&#8217;s wish, expressed in view of such an event
as this.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can I help it!&#8221; argued the girl, dashing
down the long flights of stairs two steps at a
time. &#8220;How can I see her suffer so and not try
to get somebody who knows more than we do to
relieve her! Even though it will take her many
hours of hard labor to pay for the physician&#8217;s
visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Robert led Mr. Brook into the corner,
dignified by the name of &#8220;withdrawing room,&#8221; and
the old gentleman laid his hand affectionately
upon the boy&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;My dear, I would
like to help you all, if I can. I do not wish to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
ask you anything which your mother would not
be willing you should answer; but anything that
you can tell me about your affairs, anything which
your conscience does not warn you had best be
kept to yourself, I wish you would tell me. Remember
I was the friend of your grandfather, and
try to feel as if you were talking to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>This speech was better suited to the ears of the
elder son than to those of &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty,&#8221; and
in the first case would have been answered judiciously;
but judgment and reticence were qualities
unknown to this small boy, and he now made
as clean a breast of family matters as he was
capable of doing. If there was anything he did
not tell, it was something he had forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. Brook listened with sympathy and some
compunction; and as soon as the physician whom
Beatrice had summoned pronounced Mrs. Beckwith
&#8220;out of danger for the present,&#8221; took his
leave, hunted up the long-suffering cab-driver who
had brought him thither, and returned to his
hotel.</p>

<p>There he burst rather excitedly into his own
apartments, with the exclamation &#8220;I&#8217;ve found
them, Dolloway! The Beckwiths, at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221; returned the other old
fellow, who had left his bed for a cushioned chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
close to a grate fire, and who had the name of
being Mr. Brook&#8217;s servant, but was, at times, his
master&mdash;through rheumatism, which mastered
both.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have. That must be what my anxiety
to see the horse-show meant. Else why, after all
these years, should I have been suddenly rendered
too uneasy to abide at home, and must needs
not only put myself out but you as well? How
goes it, Dolloway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad, sir; about as bad as it can be. But a
body must expect that who goes a trapesing off
after will-o&#8217;-wisps, at our time of life, leaving
good, respectable feather beds to sleep on boards
in a barn of a place like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not boards, Dolloway. The best mattresses
the city affords, the manager assures me; and
comfortable enough to those who like them.
Yes, yes, yes. In some ways it is a pity. Yet&mdash;it
is the most fortunate thing. Had any
supper, Dolloway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want any, sir. Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! I do. They had what they called
supper, I suppose, poor things! And I&#8217;m
ashamed to mention it; only I feel hungrier
than if I hadn&#8217;t eaten anything; so, since you
have not, take a cup of coffee with me, man, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
lay aside formality for once. What will we have
besides the coffee, Dolloway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t eat a bite, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;d not refuse to please your old
master, would you, lad? When we have taken
all this trouble we want to make our holiday
seem a bit like old times. Eh? In the old
days, Dolloway, you could out-eat and out-drink
me. Yes, yes, you could, indeed! What shall
it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I must I must, and I&#8217;m obliged to
you, sir, though I only do it to please you. I
heard one of the waiters saying there was a lot of
nice venison come in from the West, sir. If it
were not spoiled in the cooking a venison steak&mdash;done
to a turn, sir, done to a turn, as you like
it yourself, Mr. Brook&mdash;might relish a little.
Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing, lad, the very thing! I will
ring and order it immediately.&#8221; Without waiting
to be served by his servant, who remained
composedly in his arm-chair, Mr. Brook pulled
the rope, which he preferred to any modern
&#8220;button&#8221; for bell-ringing purposes, and gave an
order for a meal that would have made the Beckwith
family&#8217;s eyes open in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine thing to have such an appetite as ours,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Dolloway, at our age! A very fine thing, indeed.
Eighty I shall be on my next birthday, and you
but two years younger. And I warrant me there
are no two other old chaps in this town who will
sit down to this kind of a dinner with the relish
we will. Eh? That&#8217;s the best of using gifts
and not abusing them. And my waist measures
no more than it did in my youth, lad; which
shows I have not been a gourmand, though the
truth is I like good living. I like good living
immensely. I would like to tell you what a
pretty family of five had prepared. Potatoes!
nothing but potatoes, except, of course, the inevitable
bread and butter and the detestable tea.
I don&#8217;t wonder the woman had heart-failure, poor
thing! And the air of that &#8216;flat&#8217;&mdash;it was
enough to stifle a body. After our air at home,
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Then I suppose I am not to know
anything about Mr. Conrad&#8217;s folks, save what you
choose to tell me in driblets, sir,&#8221; remarked
Dolloway, in the injured tone of one suffering
ungratified curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know all that I do myself, old
fellow; but let us take it over our dinner. I
want your advice, too. I am sorry to say that
Conrad left his people poorly off.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;Mr. Beckwith is dead, then, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead this forty years, lad. Dead for forty
years&mdash;that boy!&#8221; And Mr. Brook sank into
a chair opposite his companion, and at the same
time into a reverie so deep that even the highly
privileged Dolloway dared not interrupt the current
of his master&#8217;s thought.</p>

<p>Small Robert was in bed and should have been
asleep; but Beatrice, listening, heard a forlorn
little yawn and knew that the excitement of the
evening or the tea-and-chrysanthemum dinner had
been too much for his nerves. This suited her
exactly; and watching her chance she stole into
the room, or bed closet, known as &#8220;the boys&#8217;,&#8221;
and perched herself on the pillow where Roland&#8217;s
head would repose somewhat later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Bob! Asleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I ain&#8217;t. What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am. I&#8217;ve something to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t done nothin&#8217;. What have I done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but goodness, small sir. Bonny
doesn&#8217;t scold, does she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; answered the truthful child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she isn&#8217;t going to now. She wants your
assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; ter sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! I don&#8217;t want you to do anything to-night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
I want to consult with you. Bob, are
you awake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; ter bother a feller at night,
I be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit up in bed. Here, put my jacket around
you. I&#8217;ve a scheme&mdash;a splendid scheme!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t like your schemes. Last one didn&#8217;t
turn out worth a snap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This one will. I see how you and I can
make some money. Sit up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sitting up. How can we make it?&#8221;
asked the cash-greedy child, interested at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know those chrysanthemums?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well; here, let me whisper. We&mdash;can&mdash;sell&mdash;them!
And make a lot of dollars&mdash;maybe.
Make something, anyway. Enough to
pay for the doctor&#8217;s visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice Beckwith! They was give to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so loud. Mother is asleep,
Roland is writing, Belle studying. Only you
and I are to know about this. Yes, I know they
were given to me. To <i>me</i>, understand. That is
why I dare do this thing. And don&#8217;t reproach
me for parting with them. It breaks my heart
to do it; only it don&#8217;t break it into such little
bits as it gets broken into every time I think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Motherkin and how hard she works. To come
to the point. I want you to get up with me early
to-morrow and go on the street and try to sell the
flowers. Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious! Would you&mdash;<i>you</i> yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would&mdash;I myself. I would do anything
rather than be so idle. The flowers are mine.
We have all enjoyed them. They did us good
that way; now I want to make them do us good
some other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! How much will you give me fer my
share?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercenary little wretch! not a cent! I want
every single cent for Motherkin. You wouldn&#8217;t
take anything away from Motherkin, would you,
Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that way. I wouldn&#8217;t no quicker&#8217;n you
would. But if I had a little &#8216;capital&#8217; I could
sell papers like the other kids do on Fourteenth
Street an&#8217; round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, you are not a &#8216;kid.&#8217; You are a well-born
boy. I thought you did sell papers, anyway,
almost every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fer the other fellers, that&#8217;s all. I don&#8217;t
make my livin&#8217;. If I had enough I could make
a pile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see. But those chrysanthemums.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Think of the value. Forty times seventy-five
cents! Forty times porterhouse steaks all round
the family. About one hundred and twenty tip-top
oyster stews. Potatoes, galore. Bread&mdash;bread
enough to pave the street from here to
Union Square. And six weeks&#8217; rent. Think of
it, &#8216;Humpty-Dumpty,&#8217; and cease to wonder that
I can hardly wait till daylight to set about the
business. Will you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, if Mother&#8217;ll let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You blessed little stupid! Mother is not to
know a word about it, till it is past forbidding.
Else she has such peculiar ideas about politeness
that she might stop us. If you do as I want, as
well as you can, I&#8217;ll give you all you can make
out of the best flower in the lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain. What time &#8217;ill I start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till after breakfast. Not till you go to
school. Then, instead of going to school, go with
me up on Twenty-third Street, and there we&#8217;ll
seek our fortune. Stay! I&#8217;ve a splendid thought
now! We&#8217;ll go to the very store where they
were bought and sell them back. They, the store
folks at least, would know the value. Then we
wouldn&#8217;t either of us have to stay away from
school, and we could meet somewhere on the way
home and come in together, with flying colors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
So, if Mother wasn&#8217;t especially pleased at first, we
could brace each other up in coaxing her round to
look at the matter as we do and eating one of
her chrysanthemums turned into oysters for her
dinner that very day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. But&mdash; Wull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull me no wulls, my son!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Motherkin don&#8217;t coax worth a snap. An&#8217;
what if she should be &#8216;grieved&#8217;? I wouldn&#8217;t
mind her talking, so much; but when she sits
round an&#8217; don&#8217;t say anything, only look solemn,
it&mdash;it&mdash;breaks me all up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t a nice expression for a nice little
boy. Say &#8216;it disturbs me&#8217;; that is more
elegant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who cares for el&#8217;gunce! I hate them times
when lumps come in throats. I&#8217;ve had &#8217;em.
I&#8217;d ruther be whipped, like other kids is; I
would, so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Robert Beckwith. I <i>can</i> do this
thing all by myself. I don&#8217;t need to ask you or
anybody to help me, but I thought you&#8217;d like to
do something nice for Motherkin. If you don&#8217;t
like to it&#8217;s all right;&#8221; and Bonny rose to go,
with that independent air which experience had
taught her would invariably bring her small
brother to terms.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>&#8220;Hello! Who&#8217;s a not wantin&#8217; ter? But&mdash;if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If trouble comes I&#8217;ll take all the blame, as
I should, for it belongs to me. And I&#8217;m glad
Mother is in bed now, so I can take the basket
out of the room without anybody asking questions.
Good-night. Not a word, now, to Roland when
he comes in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. You might know I ain&#8217;t a blabber,
anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;re not. I depend on you.
Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice passed into the parlor and lifted her
treasure from the table, then turned to leave as
quietly as she had entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going with those, Bonny?&#8221;
asked Isabelle, drowsily; and her sister started as
if she had been guilty of wrong-doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they will keep better if I take them
out of the basket and put them in a pail of
water,&#8221; replied Bonny, hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they would. But it seems a pity
to disturb such a perfect arrangement, and I do
not think they would wither even that way very
soon. They last well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of that. I would not have them
wither for anything!&#8221; replied the innocent conspirator,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
feeling as if she wanted to bury her face
in the flowers and cry; only she reflected that
salt water was supposed to be injurious to delicate
petals and refrained. But when she went to bed
that night she had taken each chrysanthemum
carefully from its mossy nest and, after clipping
its stem slightly, plunged it into a pail of fresh
water and placed it in the coolest place the house
afforded.</p>

<small>IN OLD TRINITY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;FLOWERS? Flowers? Chrysanthemums?
Any, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventy-five cents apiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Girl, you must be crazy! I&#8217;ll give you ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice turned on her heel with all her native
dignity and some that she had prepared for this
especial occasion; having confided her intention
to the newspaper-woman on the corner, who
also occasionally sold flowers, and received the
advice to &#8220;not be beat down by nobody. Some
is ladies an&#8217; some is trash, what goes a shopping
on th&#8217; Aveny, an&#8217; you jest hold on patient,&mdash;the
right one&#8217;ll come along an&#8217; take the hull lot,
mebbe. Some woman &#8217;at&#8217;s goin&#8217; ter give a party
er sunthin&#8217; is the most like ter buy; er young
gells. Young gells is good customers, if they
happen ter have any money. Good luck go with
you, honey; an&#8217; I don&#8217;t want ter see you bringin&#8217;
home a single posy!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>With this good-speed sounding pleasantly in
her unaccustomed ears, the novice at flower selling
set her face westward with her basket on her
arm and her small brother presumably following
her; though, as he was sometimes in sight but
oftener not, she had doubts on the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway I only wanted him for company.
It seems so&mdash;so sort of dreadful to do this. I
tremble every time I open my mouth, and I am
afraid I shall not sell a single blossom, except at
the flower-shop. I hate to go there, though! It
seems so mean to sell things that have been given
you, and when you can have no chance to explain,
though, of course, I wouldn&#8217;t explain anyway.
Robert!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi! Here am I!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you walk along beside me respectably?
Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, wull&mdash;why, Bon! what makes you
look that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as if you was a-goin&#8217; ter cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not. I&mdash;I hate it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate other things worse, like Mother&#8217;s pale
face over her work. I don&#8217;t mean I hate, but&mdash;
Oh! I thought it would be easy, last night when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
we talked it over, and it isn&#8217;t. I expect every
minute to meet some of the &#8216;Conservatory girls,&#8217;
then I should about die of mortification.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m beat! If girls ain&#8217;t the queerest
things! A wantin&#8217; ter do things an&#8217; not a
wantin&#8217; ter at the same time. Here, give me
a bunch. I&#8217;ll show you. This is the way!
Flowers! <i>Flowers!</i> Here they go! Nicest an&#8217;
puttiest chrysms in the city! Cheap at seventy-five
cents! Only one place in town where a feller
can get &#8217;em! Here, young feller! Don&#8217;t you want
a button-holer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too dear!&#8221; replied the good-natured clerk
whom Robert had intercepted on his way down
town.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. You don&#8217;t seem to succeed any
better than I do, Bob. Chrysanthemums! The
rarest shade in the city!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two amateur flower-sellers had soon traversed
all the distance between their home and the
very corner where their stock had been purchased,
and yet not one blossom had been exchanged for
the desired cash that was to buy the oyster dinner.
When they came to the place where Bonny had
met Mr. Brook she paused, undecided whether to
cross into the next block or to take her stand
there; but was finally decided to do the latter by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the fact that a well-dressed woman had paused to
examine the cluster of flowers and to admire
them. She would even have bought one apparently,
but as she opened her purse, Bonny gently
mentioned the price, and the purse was closed
with a snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sev-en-ty-five-cents! I think you must be
new to the business, or you would never ask such
an absurd amount as that! H&#8217;m-m. Seventy-five
cents for one chrysanthemum!&#8221; And the woman
with the plethoric pocket-book had passed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going into the store. I can&#8217;t bear this!&#8221;
cried poor Beatrice, feeling utterly discouraged as
her bright castle in the air fell tumbling in ruins.
&#8220;They will take them, anyway, I&#8217;m sure. The
clerk said yesterday to a customer that he could
not supply the demand for blossoms of this shade.
Come on, Bob! The worst he can do is stare a
little, and it&#8217;s none of his business, certainly.&#8221;
Thus swallowing her pride, which she felt was
silly enough, Beatrice led the way into the shop
which she had visited in Mr. Brook&#8217;s company
the day before.</p>

<p>Robert followed, whistling gayly. Anything
which kept him from school was matter of rejoicing
to him, and though he realized that they
were having very hard luck he felt no more shame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
in selling posies than newspapers; but his hilarity
was suddenly checked by the dandified salesman
calling out sharply: &#8220;Out of here, boy! We
can&#8217;t have any boys in here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like ter know why not? What yer
givin&#8217; us?&#8221; demanded Bonny&#8217;s &#8220;darling,&#8221; with
all the roughness and assurance of a regular
street gamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, dear! Here, let me take yours, too.
You just step outside and wait for me till I come.
I won&#8217;t be a minute now,&#8221; whispered the sister,
persuasively.</p>

<p>But &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty&#8217;s&#8221; blood was up. What
were stores for if not for people to enter? How
did that unmannerly clerk know but that he,
Robert, wanted to buy out all the stock piled
upon those loaded counters? He&#8217;d show him!
One man was as good as another, in this world.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t wait, neither. I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; where
you go, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; ter stay as long as I like.
Say, boss! How much fer them roses, yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear out of here, you impudent little scalliwag!
You wish to buy no roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But I wish to sell some chrysanthemums,
sir,&#8221; interposed Beatrice, gently.
&#8220;These flowers were purchased here yesterday.
I should like to resell them to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>The dapper young man who had glanced admiringly
at the pretty girl on the occasion of her
previous visit, under Mr. Brook&#8217;s escort, now
stared at her superciliously. &#8220;Bought here?
Ah! Well, we never take second-hand goods,
you know. And flowers are an article that
could not be handled a second time, even if we
did. Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir, you told a lady, yesterday, that you
could not supply the demand for this color. I
have kept these very carefully. See? They are
not withered in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible, Miss. If that boy belongs to you,
you had better take him outside before he gets
into any further mischief. He has knocked down
a pile of baskets already, and if he damages&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Bonny did not wait to hear the conclusion
of the matter. With a desperate fear at her heart
that her small and independent brother would be
the cause of some dreadful trouble, she seized him
firmly by the collar and forced him before her out
of the shop.</p>

<p>The door closed behind them with the dull
thud which baize-muffled doors give, and it seemed
to her sounded the knell of her &#8220;flowery hopes,&#8221;
as she herself grimly expressed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I say, Bon! I did think you had some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
snap! What&#8217;d a feller do if he hadn&#8217;t no more
grit&#8217;n a girl, I&#8217;d like to know? Here, come
on, I&#8217;ll show you. Let&#8217;s go over to the hotel
there. That&#8217;s the Fifth Avenue, where rich folks
stays. I&#8217;ve sold papers for Jeemsy there, sometimes.
They&#8217;s a decent crowd goes in an&#8217; out.
Mebbe they ain&#8217;t all so horrid stingy as they &#8217;pear
ter be on this side. But, Bon! We&#8217;ll have ter
come down on the price. They ain&#8217;t nobody, &#8217;less
he&#8217;s jest another such old man as Mr. Brook,
goin&#8217; ter pay such a pile as that fer posies&mdash;second-hand
ones, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, where did you get all this wisdom,
and you but eight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;ve been around,&#8221; said Robert, with an
inimitable little swagger, which brought a fleeting
smile to Beatrice&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Let&#8217;s try the hotel, that is, if
the people will let us. I think I have heard that
the curbstone merchants&mdash;as we are now, dear&mdash;have
each a self-appropriated place with which
he allows nobody else to interfere. We may get
upon somebody&#8217;s &#8216;stand,&#8217; but if we do, from our
morning&#8217;s experience, I don&#8217;t fear but we shall be
so informed.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did take their places opposite the entrance
to the hotel, and so respectable and quiet-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
were they that nobody molested them; and as they
were the only flower-sellers upon that corner they
did after a while exchange some of their wares
for cash; but it was, as Robert had advised, at a
great reduction, and Beatrice was heartily discouraged.
Worse than that, a feeling of regret
that she had undertaken this thing without her
mother&#8217;s knowledge and consent began to trouble
her as it had not done while the first enthusiasm
of unselfishness lasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish&mdash;I wish I had not slipped out of the
house, as if I were doing something wrong!&#8221;
murmured the girl, half aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; asked Robert. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t it getting
cold? Ginger! My toes is &#8217;most froze. This
ain&#8217;t half the fun newspapers is. A feller can
keep warm that way. He can jump on street-cars,
and off when the conductor catches him.
Let&#8217;s go home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go, dear, if you are cold. I am not.
That is I&mdash;I&mdash; No, I will not give up beaten
this way. I will sell these flowers if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can!&#8221; interjected Robert, just in time
to prevent Bonny&#8217;s making a very rash vow.</p>

<p>She substituted a rather forced laugh for the
vow, and again urged her brother to go and leave
her. &#8220;There is no need for us both to be miserable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Besides, if you should take cold I should
never forgive myself. Do go; there&#8217;s a dear,
and I am ever and ever so grateful to you for
what you have already done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir-ee. I guess I&#8217;ve got grit if you haven&#8217;t.
But if you don&#8217;t mind I&#8217;ll just run around the
block ter start my toes up, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll be back so&#8217;s
you can run, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Off bounded the child, and, small as he was,
Beatrice felt no fear that he would be lost even
in a neighborhood of which he knew so little;
but as she watched him out of sight, a voice
spoke in her ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What lovely, lovely chrysanthemums! Are
they for sale, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. She doesn&#8217;t think I look like a regular
flower-girl,&#8221; thought Bonny, complacently,
and answered promptly: &#8220;Yes, madam. They
are, as you have noticed, a very peculiar shade.&#8221;
Then she raised her eyes, and met&mdash;those of the
richest girl in her class at the Conservatory, the
very one who was to sing with her at the next
reception.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness! Miss Beckwith! Beg pardon! I
did not notice. I thought it was a flower-girl
standing here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice gasped, tried to smile, felt her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
flame, and her courage&mdash;or temper, she didn&#8217;t
know which&mdash;rise at the same time. &#8220;There is
no mistake, Miss Agnew. I <i>am</i>, temporarily, a
flower-girl. These chrysanthemums <i>are</i> for sale.
But I have had rather bad luck. They prove to
be a more expensive sort than most passers-by
care for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Agnew&#8217;s own color rose a little. She was
a gentle, high-bred girl, and she saw at once that
there was something out of the common in her
classmate&#8217;s action. If the flowers had cost all
there was in her purse, she would have taken
some of them then. &#8220;Indeed? I have never
seen any like them, except at the show last
week. How much are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They cost seventy-five cents each, yesterday,
and I was told they were prize flowers. They
are&mdash;anything I can get for them&mdash;now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t call that high! I often have to
pay a dollar or more for roses at holiday time.
Of the sort I like. I think these would just suit
Mamma. I will take a dozen, please. I was
sorry you were not at class to-day. The Professor
went over our duet with me, and I gathered
some new ideas from him. He is very anxious
it should be a success; and naturally I am. Will
you be there next lesson?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;Yes, I think so. At least, I shall not be
absent for the same reason as to-day,&#8221; said
Beatrice, with a return of something like her
natural manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good! I can sing so much better with
you than with anybody else,&#8221; remarked Miss Agnew,
smiling pleasantly, nodding cordially, and
passing onward immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I&#8217;m in for it now! If Helen Agnew
is inclined to tell, the whole class can &#8216;point
the finger of scorn&#8217; at me to-morrow. But how
cold it is! How warm <i>she</i> looked! She had
evidently been having luncheon at this great
hotel, for she came out, or rather she walked
along with a &#8216;rocky&#8217;-looking old gentleman,
using a toothpick. I suppose he was her father.
How nice it must be to have a father! And
think of being able, a school-girl, out of one&#8217;s
own pocket money, to buy a dozen chrysanthemums
for one&#8217;s mother&mdash;at such a price! Yet,
after all, selling them for one&#8217;s mother may be
just as noble. I&#8217;ll &#8216;play pretend&#8217; it is, any way.
And I am quite refreshed. I&#8217;ll &#8216;buckle tae&#8217; with
a good will now! There are only twenty-five
left; and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice fell to ruminating. She forgot that
she was on a street corner, presumably to sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
flowers. She paid no attention to the rude
pushes and jostles that she received, but swayed
this way and that, accommodating her slight
person to the needs of the crowd, till one more
urgent pedestrian than the others suddenly caught
the handle of his walking-stick in that of her basket
and ruthlessly tore it from her grasp.</p>

<p>Beatrice aroused herself with a scream. &#8220;My
flowers! Oh, my flowers! Please, please, don&#8217;t
tread upon them, people! Please give me time
to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh! Bon, what&#8217;s the matter? Who took
&#8217;em? This chap?&#8221; demanded Robert, who had
returned, and eagerly catching hold of the wrong
person. &#8220;Look a here, man! You&#8217;d better look
out how you steal my sister&#8217;s chrysms! I&#8217;ll let
you know I&mdash; Ginger! There&#8217;s the old fellow
himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas! the inevitable crowd! Nobody can utter
a sound above the natural, but dozens of itching
ears must pause to learn why.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, Miss. It was an accident. I
am extremely sorry. Are they injured? Ah! I
see. Hopelessly. The price, please, I will make
good the loss; but I am in a hurry&mdash; Yes, Dolloway,
directly. Keep close to me, Dolloway. I&#8217;ll
look out for you. Eh? Hey? What?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Bonny was stooping to gather up her ruined
treasure, but something in the voice startled her,
a peculiar softness of the <i>r</i>&#8217;s, and a broad
inflection of the <i>a</i>&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the corner of Fate!&#8221; cried the girl,
recklessly, and lifted herself face to face with
Mr. Chidly Brook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Beckwith! It is, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />


<small>&#8220;HUMPTY-DUMPTY&#8217;S&#8221; NOVEL EXPERIENCE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;OH, sir! Will you ever forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive you, my dear! I am the one to
be forgiven, I should think. And I appreciate
your wearing my gift, and am exceedingly sorry
I ruined the flowers. However, they can easily
be replaced. Odd that we should meet just here
again! Were you returning from your school?
And how is your mother to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother is better, thank you, though I have
not seen her since early morning. But I am not
returning from school, and I was not wearing
your flowers. I cannot let you think anything
so kind of me as that. I was selling them!&#8221;</p>

<p>The four people of the group had retreated to
the wall of the hotel, aside from the passing
throng, and Mr. Dolloway had been eyeing Robert,
who returned the stare, very much as a big
dog eyes a little one before making acquaintance.
If there was one object in the world of the
old fellow&#8217;s special detestation, it was the average
small boy. He was always ready to ascribe to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
them all the sins of the decalogue with many
original additions; and he now suspected the
little brother of Beatrice of having caused Mr.
Brook&#8217;s detention for some evil purpose of his
own. He was not even convinced otherwise
when presently his master recovered sufficiently
from the astonishment Bonny&#8217;s words had caused
to explain: &#8220;These are Conrad Beckwith&#8217;s grandchildren,
Dolloway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! How do you do?&#8221; asked the old
servant, feeling he must say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;First-rate!&#8221; responded Bob, heartily. &#8220;Howdy
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m, I&#8217;m well enough, but they&#8217;s a cold
wind blows round this corner, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lad, I know it. But did you wish to
say anything further to me, Miss Beckwith?&#8221;
asked the considerate Mr. Brook, trying to make
his manner as cordial as it had been, but failing
signally.</p>

<p>Beatrice felt desperate. She must make this
kind, gentle old man understand that she had
not been selling his gift for a mean, selfish reason;
yet how was she to do so? It was unkind
to keep him standing in that bleak place any
longer, nor did she wish to visit any more stores
in his company.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Yes; I do want to tell you about it. I would
be glad to talk with you about everything; but
where can I? Will you go back to my mother&#8217;s
house with me? Or where can I go with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My child, do not distress yourself about these
trumpery posies. They were yours. You had a
perfect right to do with them as you chose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to explain. I am not so mean
as you think me, and yet I am a great deal
worse. I played truant to-day, like a bad little
boy, and persuaded Robert to do the same. My
poor mother knows nothing about this affair, and
she will be mortified when she hears. Besides,
I would like to ask your advice, somebody&#8217;s
advice anyway, and you say you were grandfather&#8217;s
friend. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, my dear. Have you had
your dinner yet?&#8221; Mr. Brook glanced from
the sister to the brother, as he spoke, and the
brightening of Robert&#8217;s black eyes was sufficient
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. But we will get that as soon as we
get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I have it! Let us take a carriage down
to my hotel, where I am sure of being served as
I like, and you two take dinner with me there.
Then we can have ample time to talk, as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
a comfortable place to do it in. Will you?
What do you say, Robert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say yes an&#8217; thank you,&#8221; answered the child
promptly, and with more civility than might have
been expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not like to give you that trouble and&mdash;and
expense,&#8221; said Bonny na&iuml;vely, alert as poverty
had made her to the value of money. &#8220;Besides,
we should be going home soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have played truant for a little while,
you may as well continue a bit longer. I am as
anxious to talk with you as you can possibly be
with me, and I will be responsible to your mother
for this added delay; that is, if you are not
positively needed at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. No, I am not needed now. I
am not of much account there anyway; and we
shall be very happy to accept your invitation,&#8221;
added Bonny, with a sudden change of determination
induced by a hasty study of her little
brother&#8217;s face. How hungry he did look! How
good a real dinner would taste to the child!
Well, if people didn&#8217;t mean what they said they
should be punished by being believed!</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Brook&#8217;s smile at her acceptance told
certainly enough how sincere had been his invitation;
and in a few seconds more the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
party were driving down Broadway, and Robert
felt himself of considerable more importance than
when he had interviewed pedestrians on the flower
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like riding, lad?&#8221; asked Mr. Brook,
amused at the earnest expression of the boy&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like it! You bet! It&#8217;s bully!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolloway frowned and sniffed. &#8220;Talk English,
can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows what I mean; so do you,&#8221; replied
&#8220;Humpty-Dumpty&#8221; instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rob! don&#8217;t be impertinent!&#8221; cried Beatrice,
warningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t impertinent. I do like it. Bully means
tip-top. I don&#8217;t mean anything out the way,
only it does bother me to talk c&#8217;rect. I will
when I get older, mebbe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Train up a child in the way&mdash;&#8221; said Dolloway;
but got no further, for Robert&#8217;s exclamations
effectually stopped all other conversation,
even if his elders had been inclined to converse;
and pleasant though the ride was, all save the
boy were glad when the carriage drew up before
the substantial old hostelry where Mr. Brook felt
was the only positive comfort to be found in the
city.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our parlor, my dear. Isn&#8217;t it a good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
old-fashioned room? Our bedrooms open off from
it. I have put up at this &#8216;inn&#8217; for many years;
that is, I used to do so when I was in the habit
of spending much of my time in town. Did I
mention to you that we return home in the
morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So soon!&#8221; exclaimed Beatrice, and wondered
why she felt so sorry.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been here for several days. My
sister will expect us. Now, my dear, I want
you to tell me anything you wish. Rest assured
I will advise you to the utmost of my wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny looked up and saw Mr. Dolloway&#8217;s eyes
fixed curiously upon her. There was not a particle
of sympathy in his face and it was evident
that girls were not much more to his taste than
boys. She felt that she could not say a word
before him, and she did not know how to place
him, whether as friend or servant of her host.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Brook saw this hesitation and
rightly interpreted it; for he rose almost at once
and said: &#8220;I would like to go down to old
Trinity before I return home. I&#8217;ll leave you,
Dolloway, and our young friend Robert to order
the dinner, and Miss Beckwith and I will walk
down to the church,&mdash;that is, if she will favor
me with her company. By the time we come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
back, dinner will be ready to serve, and I shall
be able to satisfy Joanna&#8217;s questions about her
old place of worship. Does that plan suit everybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny sprang up instantly. &#8220;I think you have
a gift for plans which please everybody, dear sir!
I was never in Trinity Church but once, though I
was born and have always lived in New York. I
should like to go very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us be off. Will the arrangement
suit Robert? If not&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather stay here, thank you, sir,&#8221; said
the boy; &#8220;and did you mean &#8217;at I could have
<i>anything</i> I wanted to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Order anything you wish, that is
in market. I remember how hungry I used to
get when I was a school-boy. I&#8217;m hungry still;
so don&#8217;t forget to look out for me, too. Good-by
for a little while;&#8221; and nodding gayly to the
lad, Mr. Brook led the way into the street and
down it to the church.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like this old place. I can remember it for
so long. To step into it out of the rush of
Broadway is almost like being recreated,&#8221; said
Mr. Brook, reverently, as they entered and
passed slowly up the broad aisle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Bonny could say nothing. Her mind was in a
ferment of eagerness to tell this new-old friend
everything concerning herself and her dear ones.
She felt that he would understand and be able to
explain the &#8220;muddle&#8221; in which she found herself
without her saying a word, and yet she wanted
to leave nothing for him to guess at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you sit down here with me, Mr. Brook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They took the places Beatrice had designated,
and as she looked up into the kindly, interested
face all her trouble passed away. &#8220;You must
have seen, sir, that we are very poor. When I
looked at that basket of flowers I thought it
was dreadful to have anything of such value
wasted in that way, while my precious mother
is toiling her life out to keep her family in
simple necessaries. Then it came into my head
that I might sell them. I never did such a
thing before, though I would not have been
ashamed to if&mdash; No, that isn&#8217;t quite honest. I
don&#8217;t like to earn money that way, but I would
be glad to earn it regularly, by any straight-forward,
hard work, if I might be allowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How &#8216;allowed,&#8217; my dear? Can you not work
if you will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that is just it. Mother thinks her geese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
are all swans, and must not swim in common
mill-ponds. So she is just killing herself to
keep Isabelle at the fashionable school where she
studies art, in pay for her&mdash;Belle&#8217;s&mdash;looking
after &#8216;primaries.&#8217; That way it doesn&#8217;t cost anything
for the instruction; but clothes do cost,
such clothes as my sister must wear if she goes
fitly among such rich pupils, cost a great deal
for us. Roland is the happiest of all, maybe;
because he does generally earn his own way.
That is, what he earns has mostly paid the
rent, only now he&#8217;s lost his place. I think it
was the knowledge of that which upset Mother,
last night. Her courage has been stretched so
much that it is wearing out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he lose his position? What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was some sort of a clerk in a wholesale
dry-goods house. I suppose he quarrelled with
his employer. He hated it. He said it would
have seemed a great deal manlier to him to
sell stoves or steam-engines, or something not
so womanish as silks and velvets; but I fancy
it would have made no difference. He was
born to live out of doors. He&#8217;s a different
boy when he happens to get an outside &#8216;job,&#8217;
once in a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old is he?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Sixteen. Belle is one year older than he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you study, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much but music, now. Mother has a
friend who is interested in the best Conservatory
here, and I have the benefit of instruction there.
I have an idea that this lady, this friend, pays
my expenses, or advances the money to Mother
for that purpose, though I do not know. I asked
once, but was not told. Mother is certain I have
a fortune in my voice, and she is killing herself to
keep me in training. I cannot say I have not.
I have no wish to run down my only legitimate
stock in trade, but I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m a Patti or
a Jenny Lind. I may be, of course. Brother
Robert is too little to be anything but the dearest,
sweetest small chap in the world. So there you
have us. We are not beggars, exactly; for Mother
has a little bit of an income which ekes out the embroidery
money, and so we manage. But it isn&#8217;t
as it should be, and what I want to know is:
Could such a family as ours make a living in the
country somewhere? Do you think our &#8216;talents&#8217;
could be put to any sensible use? And&mdash;do you
forgive my selling your flowers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I am glad if they brought you one
bit of additional money. I wish you had had
double the number&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;Oh dear! I don&#8217;t! That sounds saucy.
But I never in the world could make my salt
that way. I haven&#8217;t the patience, and I have
too much pride. But I did get quite a nice little
sum for them, and I am sure it will do Motherkin
a lot of good. Only her pride will suffer, and her
heart ache a little that I could do anything without
telling her first. We never have any secrets
in our small household; and I have been so low-spirited
all day over mine. Only, of course, I
shall make a clean breast of the business as soon
as I get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Beckwith, or Beatrice, if you will let me
call you so, I thank you for your confidence in
me. I want to prove myself to you all that my
Conrad would have been to any one dear to me,
if I can. But I see very clearly that your mother
is proud and self-reliant. She is not of the sort
to whom one can offer pecuniary aid without
offering a sting as well. I am of the same kind
myself. I should not like to receive benefits at
all, unless I had a chance of repaying them. I
agree with the doctor that Mrs. Beckwith would
be better in the country; but I dare not propose
my poor knowledge of what is best for you youngsters
against a mother&#8217;s wish and wisdom. Still,
continue to trust me for a little while. Some way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
will open to help you; and Joanna will advise
me. I never take any important step without
consulting her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny looked her surprise. Mr. Brook was a
hale, strong-hearted man of eighty years. How
odd that he should need to take counsel of anybody,
least of all of a woman! &#8220;Is Joanna the
sister of whom you spoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. A wise and dear friend she has been to
me all my life. She and I live together at the
old homestead in New Windsor with the servants
who have been long in our employ. I hope you
will know her soon. You are certain to love her
if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny&#8217;s quick sympathy sent a momentary
moisture to her bright eyes, which Mr. Brook
saw clearly enough, even without his glasses, which
had fallen from his nose. &#8220;Why, what, my
dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;nothing, sir! Only that is so
beautiful! I wonder if my Roland will love me
like that when he is old, and I am! We are the
&#8216;closest chums&#8217; now; but&mdash;do you suppose it
will last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hope it will last, my dear. And it certainly
will if you do your sisterly share to make it.
Never for one moment allow yourself to forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
that you are children of one mother,&mdash;the brave
little mother who has toiled to keep you in one
fold. Then I am as positive it &#8216;will last&#8217; as that
our dinner must be waiting us now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny sprang up at once. &#8220;Thank you, Mr.
Brook. And if your sister does not see how
to help us into a sensible way of living, still I
shall always remember you gratefully; and I will
try to be to my Roland what Miss Brook has been
to you. I will, indeed. But I am glad to go
back to Robert. He is rather uncertain in his
behavior, though the dearest little fellow in the
world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; laughed Mr. Brook, dryly; and with
so much of mischief in his fine old face that again
Beatrice was reminded of the picture her mother
had seen in the chrysanthemums, and she beguiled
the way back to the hotel by a description
of the little scene when the basket had arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was pretty, very pretty. Joanna must
certainly know your mother; and I have a scheme
in my mind that, meeting her approval, will bring
many happy days to all of us, I trust.&#8221; The old
man looked up cheerily, and caught Bonny&#8217;s wondering
gaze fixed upon his face. &#8220;Ah, ha, my
dear! You see that youth has no monopoly of
&#8216;looking forward.&#8217; A man may be a deal happier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
at eighty than he ever was at eighteen. I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the hotel none too soon. Dinner
had been ready for some moments, and both Mr.
Dolloway and Robert were in the condition of
temper which hungry men, of any size, not possessing
more than the usual amount of &#8220;grace&#8221;
commonly exhibit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny! I want to go home! Right away!
That horrid old man has&mdash;sp-sp-spanked&mdash;me!&#8221;</p>

<small>DINING IN STATE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;IMPOSSIBLE!&#8221; cried Beatrice, catching the
angry boy in her arms, and casting a defiant
glance toward the irate Mr. Dolloway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when a young one don&#8217;t know any better
than to sass his elders he&#8217;d ought to be spanked.
So I done it. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll do it again, if I ever have
occasion to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolloway!&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice was surprised to hear how stern Mr.
Brook&#8217;s voice could become, and she was delighted
to see the other old fellow wince visibly. The
sternness had gone home to the servant&#8217;s guilty
heart, as it should.</p>

<p>&#8220;Truth, sir. Begging your pardon for sayin&#8217;
so. Here was I, laying myself out to entertain
the boy; a telling stories till my jaws ached, and
answering questions by the thousand till I couldn&#8217;t
talk no more. Then I remembered the checker-board
we&#8217;d brought along, and I tried to learn him
how to play. The sass he give me&mdash;beat all!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
He knows more&#8217;n I do; more&#8217;n you do, sir;
more&#8217;n the President of these United States and
Queen Victory into the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t! I&mdash;never!&#8221; sobbed Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did. You do&mdash;er you think you do!
Didn&#8217;t you conteradict me plain to my face about
them moves? Didn&#8217;t you just as good as say I
cheated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull&mdash;wull&mdash;wull&mdash;you did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Bob! Let the old man tell his story
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If&mdash;if he gets his in fust&mdash;who&#8217;s a-goin&#8217;
ter b&#8217;lieve mine?&#8221; demanded &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty,&#8221;
with renewed energy. &#8220;Fust off he knocked me
down with the checker-board. Think I was goin&#8217;
ter stan&#8217; that? I guess not! So I hit him with
my fist. That&#8217;s all they was to it. An&#8217; I&#8217;d a
been satisfied nen to quit an&#8217; begin over again, if
he&#8217;d a played fair. But he wouldn&#8217;t. Nen&mdash;he&mdash;he
caught me up&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, now. Try not to think about
it. And if you have been naughty you must
apologize to Mr. Dolloway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This&mdash;this is distressing!&#8221; exclaimed poor
Mr. Brook, who hated a quarrel. &#8220;Try, both of
you, to forget all about it. You were probably
both almost starved. So I&#8217;ll order in the dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
at once, and that will set us all straight. Come
here, my little man. Here is a quarter for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the &#8220;little man&#8221; was beyond the allurements
of tips. He had sustained an indignity
which it seemed to him he could never forget. It
had been part of Mrs. Beckwith&#8217;s gentle rule that
no physical violence should ever be visited upon
her children. In the street the boys had taken
their share of rough-and-tumble fighting with
other boys, but in their own home or at their
schools neither had ever received a blow. The
fact and the method of Mr. Dolloway&#8217;s punishment
was, therefore, the more infuriating and
humiliating to the really proud little boy, who
was at heart as &#8220;good&#8221; as his doting sister constantly
declared him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, darling!&#8221; whispered Bonny. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
make poor Mr. Brook feel any worse. He is unhappy
about his man&#8217;s rudeness to you. Go! Be
generous, and take it!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was putting the matter in a new light;
and Robert despised anything like want of generosity.
He hesitated but a second longer, till
Bonny added, &#8220;Go, dear!&#8221; and then he marched
straight to Mr. Brook and laid his soiled hand
confidingly upon that gentleman&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull&mdash;I&#8217;ll take it to &#8217;blige you, not him. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
ain&#8217;t a takin&#8217; no pay fer what he done, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
lick him yet, if I get big enough. Thank you,
sir. There comes the waiter man. He&#8217;s been in
here a lot o&#8217; times a&#8217;ready. I guess it&#8217;s dinner,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it is. In fact, I know it is. Now,
my son, what did you order? And I hope you
did not forget me. I&#8217;m as hungry as a bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are bears hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have that reputation. I am not acquainted
with any bears myself, so I cannot
speak from experience. Come, Dolloway, here is
your especial bit of venison steak again, I see.
Come, draw up to the table, all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolloway sniffed, &#8220;After you is manners
for me, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff and nonsense, lad! Waive formality
for once, and take a bit of dinner with an old
friend&mdash;not after him. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, sir; thank you, I never could relish
my victuals with young ones to the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolloway! sit up. That is enough of nonsense.
And show the ill-taught child how he
should behave&mdash;if you know how yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Beatrice&#8217;s surprise, Mr. Dolloway did not
apparently resent this speech of Mr. Brook&#8217;s, and
he immediately obeyed it. She saw then that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
familiar and almost equal as the two had seemed
to her, one was still the master, the other the man.</p>

<p>The dinner began in silence, broken only by the
host&#8217;s attempts at conversation, which fell without
much response; for Dolloway was stubbornly
speechless, and the young Beckwiths were too
much impressed by the strangeness of their surroundings
to have leisure for words. Even restaurant
service, to which most young city folk
become early accustomed, was unknown to them,
for their simple meals had always been taken at
home; and the deft movements of the waiter,
perplexity as to the use of the various utensils
with which he provided them, and a close observation
of Mr. Brook and his manner of using the
big or little forks and spoons, occupied them to
the exclusion of almost everything else, even
food.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try a few of those oysters. They are delicious,
my dear, they are indeed,&#8221; urged the
entertainer, pushing the plate of half-shells gently
toward Bonny&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>Then she rallied herself. &#8220;I must not seem
ungrateful, and the food does smell so good!
Only there is so much of it! One of these
&#8216;courses,&#8217; I suppose they are, would make enough
for once at home. I wish Motherkin had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
some oysters like these! And she shall. I will
buy some on my way back.&#8221; Then she turned to
her host, and exerted herself to be as entertaining
as Bonny Beckwith certainly could be if she
willed, and before he knew it even Mr. Dolloway
was laughing.</p>

<p>In that laugh the hatchet was buried; or
rather the last ill-temper which Robert had retained
vanished, and he turned merrily toward his
enemy with the words: &#8220;My eye! This turkey
is an awful good one, ain&#8217;t it? I wish I could
have you tell me what to order, every day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was a boy I liked turkey,&#8221; answered
Dolloway, graciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me &#8216;when you was a boy,&#8217; please. If
you will I won&#8217;t be sassy no more, an&#8217; I won&#8217;t
beat you no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time. Not now. I did tell you all I
knew, &#8217;most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says you have horses of your own, Mr.
Brook!&#8221; said &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty,&#8221; suddenly remembering
this communication and wishing to
have it verified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have a number; seven in the stables
now, I think. But all are not mine; one pair is
my sister&#8217;s. Some day I hope you will come and
see them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;Ginger! Do you? Honest Injun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Why should you doubt it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;because I hit <i>him</i>, an&#8217; I&#8217;m a &#8216;young
one,&#8217; an&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;m gen&#8217;ally doin&#8217; somethin&#8217; I hadn&#8217;t
oughter. But if you mean it I&#8217;ll come, if my
mother will let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall ask her,&#8221; said Mr. Brook, cheerfully.
&#8220;I have hopes she will say &#8216;yes.&#8217; Then Dolloway,
here, shall teach you how to ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t teach nobody to break his
neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may have a horse of your own,
some day,&#8221; calmly pursued Mr. Brook, undisturbed
by Dolloway&#8217;s present rebellion against
authority.</p>

<p>Robert gasped. Such a &#8220;perhaps&#8221; literally
took his breath away. Then he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I ride him bareback?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you would attempt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I &#8217;tempted it I&#8217;d do it. They ain&#8217;t no
back down ter me; I&#8217;ve got grit, I have.
Bonny, here, she would &#8217;a&#8217; give up&mdash;kerflummux!
a sellin&#8217; those chrysms, but I made her hold on.
If it hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been fer me she wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217;
made nothin&#8217;, hardly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny winced. The least said about chrysanthemums
the better she liked it now. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
she answered: &#8220;How about the dozen which
Miss Agnew bought? Where were you at that
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert ignored the inquiry. He had now eaten
all that his capacity permitted, and he began to
think of home. Not that homesickness troubled
him, but a longing to boast of that day&#8217;s experience
over the humdrum, matter-of-fact life
which had probably gone on in the Second Avenue
flat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Bon! It&#8217;s time fer a feller ter go!
Motherkin&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; worried &#8217;bout us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Brook will excuse us we will go at
once, before the up-town cars get crowded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly! Will you ride? Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear. We are a long way from our own
neighborhood now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that. But I&#8217;ve walked it before,
when I didn&#8217;t have no such good dinner inside of
me. I&#8217;d laugh if I couldn&#8217;t now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. We&#8217;ll try it, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they were not to be permitted. When they
turned to bid their host good-by, they found him
with his hat on, ready to accompany them to the
street. &#8220;You must allow me to put you in a
cab, my dears. Yes, yes. Indeed, I shall permit
nothing else. You are to say all kind things to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the family for me, and I will write your mother
or you, after I reach home and have seen Joanna.
One thing, remember. I am not a new acquaintance.
I am an old and tried friend. You can
trust me. You can expect to see a great deal of
me, if you will. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by.&#8221; &#8220;Good-by! Don&#8217;t forget about
my visit to you!&#8221; &#8220;Thank you. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Around whirled the cab, and off up the street
sped&mdash;no, crawled&mdash;the vehicle, among the
lines of trucks and wagons, street-cars, hacks, and
carriages, till Beatrice felt she could have outstripped
that pace on her own light feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s riding, all the same, Bon! Let&#8217;s
play pretend it&#8217;s our own carriage and we have
been down town to buy a horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; a house in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Horses too. An&#8217; we&#8217;re goin&#8217; ter live &#8216;swell&#8217;
forever after. We&#8217;re goin&#8217; ter have turkey every
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every other day, dear; it would be better
for our digestion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s digestion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the one thing which the impecunious
young Beckwiths have in perfection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! What&#8217;s the use of saying words a mile
long? An&#8217; why don&#8217;t you give a real answer?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;I like to use long words. It&#8217;s the only luxury
I can afford. And the real answer is, the
prime condition of our &#8216;insides,&#8217; which allow us
to eat anything from &#8216;A to Izzard.&#8217; There, let&#8217;s
get out at this corner. I want to invest a little of
my money in a few oysters for Motherkin, as
well as to pay you the seventy-five cents I
promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>They dismissed the cab at the corner of Third
Avenue and hurried into the nearest market,
where Bonny selected with utmost care a dozen
of the very finest &#8220;bivalves&#8221; she could find; but
when she offered the promised reward to her
little brother he surprised her by refusing to take
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bob! Why not? Are you ill? What
is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t ill. Can&#8217;t a feller do a gen&#8217;rous
thing &#8217;ithout his folks &#8217;cusin&#8217; him o&#8217; bein&#8217; sick?
But, say! Wait a minute! I will take it, too.
I&#8217;ll take it an&#8217; give it to my mother myself. I
earned it fair an&#8217; square, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you did. And you are a perfect
darling that you do not wish to waste it on yourself.
Mother will be delighted with your unselfishness!
If it weren&#8217;t in the street I&#8217;d kiss you,
sweetheart!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve got a quarter,
anyway. That is more&#8217;n I&#8217;ve had in a dog&#8217;s age
before. Do you s&#8217;pose my mother will scold me
for running away from school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you draw near home your conscience begins
to prick you, doesn&#8217;t it? Mine does. I didn&#8217;t
feel half as guilty before.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was such a sympathy in this matter that
despite its being on the &#8220;street&#8221; and a place
where exhibitions of affection were out of place,
the brother and sister clasped hands with an
eagerness that told how much they really feared
the quiet glance of disapproval which Mrs. Beckwith
would make her only punishment.</p>

<p>But it was not Beatrice&#8217;s habit to acknowledge
herself worsted till compelled; and she dashed
into the little parlor of their flat crying, as gayly
as she could: &#8220;Fairy gifts, Motherkin! I&#8217;ve discovered
the secret of transmuting posies into
pounds, petals into pennies, and chrysanthemums
into oysters! Behold&mdash;and believe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem! Miss Beatrice, this is truly fortunate.
I had begun to despair of seeing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl wheeled suddenly about, and there,
spectacles on nose and music-roll in hand, sat the
Professor of Voice Culture who was training her
for &#8220;her career,&#8221; and whom she had faithfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
promised to meet that day for &#8220;a particular reason
of obligingness to me myself; that may mean
a much of benefit to the poor old Herr Doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Until that instant she had utterly forgotten the
teacher&#8217;s request and her promise, and the regret
with which she now recalled it effectually banished
all affected hilarity. Dropping her package of
&#8220;saddle rocks,&#8221; she held out both hands to the
shabby-looking German, with an accent of such
keen distress in her voice that he forgave her on
the instant: &#8220;Oh, sir! I am so sorry. But&mdash;I
never thought of it, not once. Has it made a
great difference?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&mdash;not so great&mdash;but the mother&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny turned once more, this time to be confronted
by another visitor, and oddly enough
another teacher, the head master of the parochial
institution where Robert was supposed to learn
more refinement than he could at the public
schools of the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, Mr. Benton. He has called about
Robert&#8217;s absence, fearing he was ill. He also
has a broken engagement to explain. Where
have you both been all day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! must I tell&mdash;now&mdash;before these?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know of no reason why you should not. I
hope my children have not absented themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
from their duties for any cause which they would
be ashamed to mention.&#8221; There was both pride
and pain in the widow&#8217;s tone, and Bonny opened
her lips to &#8220;make a clean breast of the matter,&#8221;
but a second thought restrained her. What she
had done might have been unwise, but she saw
no reason to explain their actual poverty to &#8220;all
the world.&#8221; For the first time in her life she refused
to answer her mother&#8217;s question, and a spot
of heightened color burned on each cheek as she
bowed and murmured: &#8220;I cannot give the reason
now, dear. Please do not press me;&#8221; and
immediately quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>But alas for the Beckwith pride! In her
haste Beatrice forgot that she had left the garrulous
&#8220;Humpty-Dumpty&#8221; behind her.</p>

<small>PROPOUNDING A RIDDLE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;GINGER! If Bon hasn&#8217;t dropped them
oysters down kerflump!&#8221; cried Robert,
picking up the brown paper parcel and laying it
on his mother&#8217;s lap. Then he plunged one pudgy
hand deep in the corner of his pocket, where the
hole had been pinned together, and produced four
silver quarters. &#8220;Hi! there, Motherkin! See
<i>them</i>?&#8221; and he cast a supercilious glance about
upon the spectators, as if pitying the envy which
must thrill their breasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see, dear. But go and make your excuses
to Mr. Benton. I have had none to make for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert immediately crossed to the master&#8217;s
side and explained: &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t come ter school
to-day, sir, &#8217;cause my sister had ter go an&#8217; sell
some chrysms on the Avenue, an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t like ter
let her go alone. It ain&#8217;t nice fer girls to go ter
places alone, my mother says.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">He cast a supercilious glance about him.</span></p>

<p>When the child had reached this point in his
disclosures Isabelle rose rather hurriedly and left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the room by the same door which had covered
Bonny&#8217;s exit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, my boy. If you have a valid reason
for your absence we will have to see about getting
you excused. But there has been too much
of this truanting, and we have resolved to put a
stop to it. We have not quite the authority
which the public school teachers have, else we
should not be so troubled. An examination for
promotion is to be held next week, and I felt that
Robert had no time to lose if he wished to go
forward with his class. Besides, he had promised
to assist me a little in preparing for an evening
entertainment in aid of the school, and I depended
on him. He was to have been a little &#8216;Red Cross
Knight,&#8217; but owing to his absence I was obliged
to give his place to another boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later both the Professor and Mr.
Benton had departed, and Bonny immediately reappeared.
&#8220;Mother! don&#8217;t look at me so
grieved. I am bad, I know; as bad as I can
be. But I don&#8217;t mean it, and I really felt as if
I were doing something very praiseworthy when
I set out on my adventures this morning. I was
in quite a glow of self-righteousness. I was,
indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the glow now, my child?&#8221; asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the mother, gently stroking the flushed face resting
on her knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone. But&mdash;but this remains;&#8221; and
she counted out the contents of her little purse,
which amounted to about ten dollars. &#8220;That
isn&#8217;t so very bad, though it&#8217;s about one fourth
of what I anticipated bringing home. As it is,
nine dollars of this came from one person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice! Not from Mr. Brook, I hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Motherkin. But <i>will</i> you forgive me?
I&#8217;ll never do so again. I promise you. And I&#8217;ve
so much to tell. I can&#8217;t wait till I tell it, yet it
doesn&#8217;t come easy with that sort of a wall of displeasure
and sorrow between us. Please take
your bad girl back, down deep into the happy
place in your heart again, Mother darling! I
hate to feel unhappy! I do, awfully!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her whimsical entreaty covered a regret so sincere
that Mrs. Beckwith understood, and stooping
kissed very tenderly the tumbled curls of her
energetic daughter. There was a trace of tears
in her own eyes as she lifted her head, but there
was no further word of blame or repentance between
them; yet Beatrice never forgot that
hour, nor did she ever again test any scheme,
no matter how brilliant its promise, without taking
her mother into confidence first.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;Well, then, that&#8217;s settled and done with. I
feel better, very much better. And Robert is
not to be blamed at all. Nor am I, even, for
part of my badness. I forgot that. Mr. Brook
has part of the blame. He claims it, and I&#8217;m
sure I&#8217;m willing he should enjoy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter, have you been to see Mr.
Brook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8217;m, I have. I&#8217;ve dined with him. At
the Astor House. In a private parlor. But that
wasn&#8217;t the beginning of the story. You should
let people begin at the beginning, Mother
dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begin at the beginning, Beatrice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The recital was given, amid the comments and
illustrations of the youngest Beckwith; no details
were omitted, and it ended with the question: &#8220;If
this good friend of our grandfather&#8217;s finds some
place that we could live in the country, would you
go, Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For my own part, I should be glad to go.
But your education, the different careers which
may be open to you here, my children, these
must be considered first. All the young people
are leaving the country places and flocking to the
towns, if we are to believe the articles we read.
If those who have been born and reared in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
country cannot make a decent livelihood there,
how can we expect to do so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Motherkin! we&#8217;re all geniuses!
That&#8217;s the theory we are living on now; and a
genius can do what no less gifted mortal can!
But all jesting aside, Mr. Brook agrees with the
doctor that your health would be a great deal
better in a country place than here; and I&#8217;ll
risk the rest of the question for that great gain.
So should you, if you love us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, dearie. The question is not to be
met to-night. But those oysters you brought in
and dropped so disdainfully upon the floor will
taste very nicely to us who have <i>not</i> dined at the
Astor House upon roast turkey and other good
things galore. Would you object to broiling me
a few?&#8221;</p>

<p>After all, the day ended merrily. The Beckwiths
had a faculty of making mirth out of
trifles, and it kept them all from growing sour
or cross-grained over the inevitable hardnesses
of their lot in life. Roland brought out his
banjo and forgot the day&#8217;s hopeless search for a
new situation in the picking up of a melody that
had caught his ear. Belle worked hard to make
a realistic &#8220;study&#8221; of chrysanthemums from the
two or three which Beatrice had left behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
her that morning on her mother&#8217;s kitchen table.
Mrs. Beckwith &#8220;outlined&#8221; a pattern against the
next day&#8217;s finer embroidering; Robert played at
jack-straws till he had &#8220;beaten himself&#8221; a satisfying
number of times; while Beatrice moved
everywhere about the little home, putting away
scattered papers and books, dusting carefully
each nook and corner, and finally sitting down
to peruse a cook-book in the hope of finding
some desirable dish for the next day&#8217;s dinner
which would cost next to nothing in the concocting.</p>

<p>A busy week followed, busy for all save
Roland, and yet even for him, though his
labors were without apparent result; and then
the postman brought the letter which all except
Bonny had nearly forgotten, the letter that Mr.
Brook was to write after consultation with his
sister, Miss Joanna.</p>

<p>It was &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty&#8221; who received the
communication from the messenger and flew upstairs
with it, crying out: &#8220;I bet this is the
country letter! I bet it&#8217;s Mr. Brook has found
a home for us an&#8217; a horse! Read it, won&#8217;t you,
Motherkin, quick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very brief, my dears; but it contains an
invitation for Roland to go up and see Mr. Brook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
at his own home. He writes that there are some
things much better discussed in person than by
mail, and unless he hears to the contrary he will
send a carriage to meet my son at the railway
station nearest his house on Thursday&mdash;why,
that is to-morrow! He adds that he trusts the
meeting will not be fruitless of good to all concerned,
else he would not suggest it. Well,
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well&#8217; means &#8216;yes,&#8217; doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; demanded
Bonny, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how much it will cost!&#8221; remarked
Roland, reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter, sir. We&#8217;ll write another poem
on somebody&#8217;s medicine and earn the price of
the trip, maybe! Anyway, there is the chrysanthemum
money which my mother has punished
me by refusing to touch; you shall take that.
Then Mr. Brook can feel that he has paid your
way and will have no scruples about that matter.
In his heart of hearts, the dear old gentleman
has been worried over it, I know, just as
well as if I had heard him say: &#8216;But, Joanna,
they are so poor! What if he goes to the expense
for nothing!&#8217; and she has comforted him
by saying: &#8216;Never mind, Chidly dear, we will
make it up to them in some way. The young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
man must come, of course.&#8217; You see how it is,
don&#8217;t you, Motherkin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that, among you, you would wheedle the
foolish old Motherkin into letting all of you sacrifice
your own best interests because you happen
to think a country life is best for her!&#8221; answered
Mrs. Beckwith, smiling fondly upon them all.
&#8220;But Roland must go. No matter if we could
afford it even less than by Bonny&#8217;s exploit we
are fortunately able, it would be a rudeness
not to accept the invitation. Yet, Roland, remember;
it is no light task you are undertaking,
and you must not bring back rose-colored reports
unless the facts will bear them out; that is, I
want you to look at everything with practical
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try, Mother. But my opinion cannot
decide the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your opinion may soon have to decide all
family matters, my son,&#8221; answered Mrs. Beckwith,
with a gravity that woke a sudden terror
in their loving hearts.</p>

<p>But Bonny would have none of this! Trouble&mdash;sorrow&mdash;should
not come to them, not such
sorrow as her mother&#8217;s tone suggested; and with
the swift rebellion of her hopeful nature she
turned upon her brother playfully. &#8220;Yes, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Laureate. Just take the poetical part of you off
and give it to me. I&#8217;ll lock it safely up in my
own bureau till you return. And, see; here&#8217;s the
money! Oh, Bob! don&#8217;t you wish you were the
big brother instead of the little one? Think of
seeing your friend Mr. Dolloway again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Three days later Roland had made his journey
and returned; and the first glance Bonny gave
to his face set her heart to beating gayly. &#8220;Oh!
I see it&#8217;s good news you bring, Laureate! You
needn&#8217;t try to look so solemn, you&#8217;re so happy
you could dance!&#8221; which was the one thing
Roland never attempted to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he is, Motherkin! And he <i>is</i> rose-colored,
though he tries not to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my son! We have missed you greatly.
But did you have a pleasant time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, it&#8217;s delightful! It is. Just the
plain, common-sense side of it is too good to be
true. It is all so much better than we any of us
dreamed that I hardly know how to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Roland!&#8221; interposed Robert. &#8220;Begin
as we like stories to do: &#8216;Once upon a
time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, little chap. &#8216;Once upon a time&#8217;
there was an old gentleman that had a great deal
of money, much more than he needed himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and he liked to do good with it. He was a
peculiar old gentleman, too. He didn&#8217;t believe
in the actual giving away of this money, as we
sometimes give to the street beggars; but he
would help those who wanted to help themselves.
He said that was the Lord&#8217;s own way, and he
certainly could not improve upon it. So all his
life long he has been putting tumble-down people
on their feet, and educating ignorant ones, and
building little homes for homeless folks, who
generally plucked up courage enough to earn the
cost of the homes themselves at last. All which
the splendid old fellow didn&#8217;t tell me himself;
but I found out by asking more questions of everybody
I met than even Bob could ask in the same
length of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t!&#8221; said Robert, indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, small sir. I&#8217;ll prove it by anybody
who saw me while I was in New Windsor town!
Well, sure enough, when I got to the station there
was a cosey carriage waiting for me, and in it, not
just the servant I had expected to see, but Mr.
Brook and the sweetest-faced old lady I ever
saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roland! <i>Did</i>&mdash;you go and take that poetry-side
out of my drawer before you started?&#8221; asked
Bonny, pathetically.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;No, miss. This is plain, unvarnished fact.
Miss Brook is like her brother, only&mdash;more so!
She looks like him, with a little smaller features
and a bonnet on. She wears white curls each side
her face, and her bonnet is big enough to cover
her head, and she had on a soft-colored old shawl;
India, I think she called it. She is very decided
and quick, but not harsh. It is only that her
mind seems to go as fast as Bonny&#8217;s does, though
more wisely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. Next chapter, please,&#8221; remarked
the object of comparison, slipping her arm within
her brother&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will skip the rest, for a minute,
and hurry to the &#8216;plan.&#8217; Mr. Brook has a
house he would like to rent us. It stands on
the land adjoining his own place, and was owned
by some city people who got dissatisfied and left.
He bought it partly as an investment, and partly
to prevent undesirable persons coming to live
there. It is old and picturesque, but it is in
good order. It has a revolutionary history,&mdash;that
is, the west side has; the eastern half is
more modern. It stands almost upon the river
bank, though on a bluff above it, and the orchard
slopes quite down to the water. The rent is two
hundred dollars a year, which is one hundred less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
than we pay now. It seemed to me that there
was more room in it than we needed, but Mr.
Brook said he thought not. And Bob&#8217;s friend,
Dolloway, who went through the house with us,
remarked: &#8216;I should think you&#8217;d be glad to
have room enough to swing a cat in for once!&#8217;
and I concluded that it might be pleasant. The
house is partly furnished; that is, there are
curtains of some sort at the windows, and matting on
the floors. There are closets everywhere,
and one room is just as General Somebody used
it. I declare, I was ashamed to find my history
so rusty, for the whole locality is historic. And&mdash;
Oh, Mother, I do hope you will think favorably
of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The main question is earning our living there;
that is, if I can bring myself to take you away
from your schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We talked that all over. There are ten acres
with the house. There is also a little greenhouse,
where Mr. Brook thinks we could raise early
vegetables and flowers for market. Miss Brook
says that you could do your embroidery there as
well as here, and that if it seemed best the girls
could come into the city for their lessons once or
twice a week. They said we ought to keep one
cow and a horse, and they had a plan by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
we could make the horse pay for its keep; that
is, if we were willing to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you, my dears? Remember it is not
congenial work, nothing to do with books and
music and art. But I was brought up in the
country myself, and I know that the only way
to get a living out of land is, as my guardian
used to say, &#8216;dig it out.&#8217; It seems strange for
us, with our ignorance, to go back and attempt
to do what the real country people have given up
as a failure. I am more than doubtful about our
success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, I never knew you to be so undecided
about anything! I have always felt you knew
long beforehand just what was best; don&#8217;t let us
think of this thing at all if it troubles you,&#8221; said
Isabelle, gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was never so much at stake before, my
dear. But I will waver no longer. Let us each
make the most of our last winter in the city, and
in the spring we will go to New Windsor. Now,
my Beatrice, if that soup of yours is ready we
will have our dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rose promptly, but soberly. Even Bonny
could not shake off the influence of her mother&#8217;s
thoughtful words, though she tried to jest as
usual, and began to sing a gay little melody that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Belle liked, till Roland interrupted her by saying:
&#8220;Oh, I forgot; here is a little letter for you, from
Mr. Brook,&#8221; and gave her an unsealed envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;For me? How nice! But&mdash;how queer!
Listen to this, all of you!&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Beatrice</span>,&mdash;The name of the place

<small>THE FIRST EVENING IN THE NEW HOME.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A FEW months later, when the spring was
just opening, Beatrice and Roland stood on
the wide porch of the old house in New Windsor,
eagerly watching the approach of a carriage which
was bringing to the Lindens the rest of their
family. The girl&#8217;s feet could not keep from
dancing, and the lad&#8217;s spirits found vent in a
whistle so merry and so spontaneous that old
Mr. Dolloway, hearing it, muttered grimly: &#8220;I
hope he can keep on a feeling that way after he&#8217;s
tried farming a spell. I don&#8217;t see any great fun
in hard work myself, an&#8217; that&#8217;s what he&#8217;ll get,
an&#8217; plenty of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I hope Motherkin will not be disappointed!
Think of her trusting everything to
her children, and saying that what we like will
certainly suit her! Was there ever such a love
of a mother in this world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Bonny, I don&#8217;t believe there ever was. I
can imagine no human being more perfect than
our mother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;I mean she shall have a splendid rest now.
This air is perfectly delicious! It fairly tingles
through my veins, it is so pure and brilliant!&#8221;</p>

<p>The brother fell to whistling again.</p>

<p>&#8220;See! The buds are really swelling on my lindens!
I wonder what their secret is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you professed to having found
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite. I did think, from the stories I
have read about Revolutionary times here, that
perhaps Mr. Brook believed there was a buried
treasure underneath those trees somewhere. But
last night I asked him, and he laughed so gayly
that I knew I was on the wrong track. Miss
Joanna laughed, too, and asked me if I thought
all the poor old soldiers had money to bury, because
she had certainly heard of enough being
searched for to supply the whole army with
wealth, and yet history told us that they suffered
great privations. There <i>have</i> been some &#8216;pots of
gold&#8217; resurrected right here in this New Windsor
town, but they did not hold enough to enrich anybody,
and their contents are preserved more as
curiosities than used to supply common wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you give up that idea entirely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Entirely. There they come. Oh, Mother!
Here at last!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Considerate in all things, Mr. Brook had sent
his own carriage to the station to bring Mrs.
Beckwith and Belle with little Robert, but he had
not accompanied it himself. He wanted the first
glimpse of her new home should be an impartial
one on the lady&#8217;s part, and he was too prejudiced
a person to refrain from pointing out this or that
favorable feature of the spot he loved so well.
So the family were quite by themselves, and free
to express their thoughts as they were inclined
without fear of wounding anybody&#8217;s preferences,
had there been any danger of their doing so.
But there was not. As Roland had said, when
he returned from that first visit of the autumn
before, &#8220;It is all so much better than one could
have dreamed!&#8221; was the one and only feeling of
the brave little woman who stepped down from
the carriage with happy face and shining eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here at last, my darling! All together once
more. Are you not tired out with all your hard
work? And, Roland, my son, it actually seems to
me you have grown, even in these few days!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grown in importance, Motherkin. He&#8217;s really
very &#8216;masterful&#8217; up here. He feels that he is the
head of the family now, in good earnest. You
should hear him say: &#8216;Bonny! that room <i>must</i> be
my mother&#8217;s. It is the very sunniest, pleasantest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
in the whole house!&#8217; in such a tone. As if a
body wished to dispute his royal highness! But&mdash;how
<i>do</i> you like it? And how did you manage
in the boarding-house, after we came away with
the &#8216;things&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we managed nicely. Did everything
come? Don&#8217;t you think you are very smart,
you two, to take the whole responsibility of
settling a house, and such a big house as this?
How nice it looks! How pretty, nay, how
beautiful, it all is! See the delicate green of
those tree-buds! And that clump of willows by
the river-side. What an exquisite color! And
the plashing of the water at the foot of the bluff!
I had no idea it was so lovely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Motherkin! That&#8217;s charming of you;
but you don&#8217;t wish to waste all your enthusiasm
out of doors, I hope. As for those willow boughs,
I can tell you exactly what to do them in. Cadmium,
Motherkin, cadmium yellow, number two,
with shadows of <i>terre verte</i> and umber. Oh! I
know! I was taken with just such an artistic
spasm the other day when I was scrubbing the
kitchen pantry, and I sat right down and made a
study of those willows on the back of the moulding-board.
I didn&#8217;t quite finish it, though, for
Roland called to me to help him with the stove-pipe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
and that sort of dampened my spirits for
a while. Stove-pipes have a depressing influence
on mankind generally, I believe; for we couldn&#8217;t
get it right, though we tried never so, and after
a little while Roland had to call on Mr. Dolloway
for advice. He&mdash; I fancy I had best not tell
what he said. It wouldn&#8217;t have been allowed in
polite society. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny, do keep still! Mother, she talks all
the time up here. That is one drawback I have
discovered to this paradise. It is either talk or
sing with Beatrice; she cannot keep still a
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind! A <i>happy</i> racket never is disturbing
to <i>me</i>. So this is my room? Well, I
thank you for selecting one so big and cheerful.
How well our old furniture does look, after all!
And what pretty matting! It&mdash;seems like a
dream. And there is almost as much space in
this one apartment as in the whole of our little
flat. I feel like a Mrs. Cr&#339;sus! And what a
light for my embroidery!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Motherkin, you are not to embroider one stitch
for one whole week. True. Roland has said so,
and you will not dare to disobey the Laureate&mdash;and
the head of the family&mdash;combined!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was indeed a cheerful, picturesque old farm-house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and could not have been situated more
pleasantly. To the east, across the river, the
highlands were violet in the light of the setting
sun, and the broad stream itself was flecked here
and there by the white-sailed boats which had
awaked from the winter&#8217;s sleep with the opening
of navigation, and now darted busily up and
down intent upon making lost time good. Barges
and steam-tugs, a steamer or two, and the rattle
of trains on both banks of the Hudson gave
what Roland called &#8220;an American flavor to an
idyllic picture,&#8221; and convinced them all that in
turning their backs upon the city they had not
left behind them all connection with its stirring
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the greenhouse, Mother! Then you
may have your supper. Miss Brook invited us
there to-night, but I asked her to excuse us. I
thought you would be tired and would like to eat
your first meal in your new home. Though we
are all to go there to dine to-morrow, and she is
coming over to see you &#8216;early in the morning,&#8217;
which means early, too! Those two people have
not a thing to do except please themselves;
and how do you think they do it? One of the
&#8216;hows&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tire us with conundrums, Bonny!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
pleaded Isabelle, who had made a swift tour of
the whole premises and now returned to the
empty little glass house where the rest had
gathered.</p>

<p>&#8220;By having their breakfast at seven o&#8217;clock the
year round!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then during the week you have passed with
them you have either suffered or been impolite!&#8221;
said Mrs. Beckwith, with conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t impolite, Motherkin. I didn&#8217;t keep
them waiting,&mdash;they wouldn&#8217;t have waited,
though,&mdash;but I was on hand every morning,
sharp. So was Roland. Oh! that youth is a
changed young man! If it only lasts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, here,&#8221; said Roland, paying no attention
to Bonny&#8217;s banter, &#8220;is where I have sowed my
celery seed. Here is lettuce; there radishes;
there onions, tomatoes, and by this side a few
early potatoes. Isn&#8217;t that like living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roland, how did you know what to do? And
how have you had time to accomplish so much
since you came? Shall you like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, you are almost as curious as Bob!
It does me good to hear it. I was taught what
to do by Mr. Brook&#8217;s gardener. And we have
not wasted any of the hours during this past
week, anyway. And I shall like it&mdash;immensely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
I never felt so much a man in all my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you ain&#8217;t a man, Roland! You&#8217;re
only a boy,&#8221; remarked Robert, feeling a bit
jealous of this big brother who had had a whole
week at the Lindens, while he had been forced to
remain in a city boarding-house till Beatrice and
the &#8220;Laureate&#8221; prepared the home for their
mother&#8217;s coming. &#8220;And don&#8217;t it look funny to
see our old things in this new house! I found
my own bed the first thing. It&#8217;s in a room all
by my own self, &#8217;cause Bon said so. That bed is
new if nothin&#8217; else ain&#8217;t, an&#8217; I&#8217;m as much &#8217;count
as you if I can have a bedroom too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that is one of the luxuries of the
situation, that each member of the household can
have his or her own little apartment to do in
just as he pleases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To do in not at all as he pleases, you mean!
That girl has fidgeted herself sick lest there
should be a speck of dirt left anywhere for your
eyes to find, Mother. And if I laid a single thing
down in my room&mdash;so-called&mdash;she&#8217;d pounce
upon it and hang it up or hide it away, lest the
place should &#8216;look like fury.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she has her reward. I really think she
has done wonders, as well as you. And now I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
think I smell a cup of tea. If your supper is
ready, Miss Housekeeper, I should be pleased to
eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had not been allowed to enter the dining-room
before. Bonny had prepared her table and
then locked the door. She wanted that room,
next to the mother&#8217;s the most cheerful room in
the house, to be a surprise to them; and she now
opened the door with a flourish of arms, then
stood back to enjoy the look of pleasure she was
sure her mother&#8217;s face would show.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how pretty! My dear, you <i>have</i> kept
the best to the last. And this will be our living-room,
our &#8216;home&#8217; room; and as we break bread
together in it for the first time, let us each resolve
that into this room, whatever of sorrow may
come, there shall never come an angry word or
an unloving thought. Three times each day,
God willing, we will gather here <i>in peace</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s call it the &#8216;peace-room&#8217; Motherkin!&#8221;
cried &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty,&#8221; touched for
almost the first time in his life to a bit of sentiment
by the sweet solemnity of his mother&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, small sir! It&#8217;s a compact!
Your hand upon it, little brother! And whenever
you get into a scrape, if ever such an unheard-of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
thing should happen, remember this
room shall be a retreat where you will be safe.
I, too; and between us&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be often unoccupied!&#8221; said Belle,
saucily, and moved her mother&#8217;s chair to its place.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a great, big fireplace! And ain&#8217;t it
wicked to burn so much wood, Roland? Must
&#8217;a&#8217; cost a heap!&#8221; remarked Bob, leaning his head
on his hands, and gazing reflectively into the
bright wood fire which flamed on the hearth.</p>

<p>He had voiced his mother&#8217;s own thought, and
she looked toward the elder son for explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Bob; it cost nothing but a little labor.
That fire is made of driftwood which washed up
on our own land. I dragged it to the wood-house
and cut it up myself. Of course, Mr.
Brook had a hand in the business, as he has in
all this good fortune. He lent me his saw and
axe; and I am to keep them till I can buy some
of my own. Think of having anybody lend you
anything! It is a new experience for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We do not want to become borrowers, on the
strength of it, more than is necessary, my dear,&#8221;
said Mrs. Beckwith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fear. I am quite as independent
as you, by nature. But I&#8217;ve found out something,
Mother. There is as much kindness in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
accepting favors, sometimes, as in conferring
them. Mr. Brook feels that he is responsible
for our being here. He wishes to help us get
started and everything running smoothly, and
then I think he means to leave us to stand on
our own feet. He has sent his man over every
day to help me about the grounds, and Mr. Dolloway&mdash;oh!
Mr. Dolloway!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny echoed her brother&#8217;s groan in so comical
a manner that Robert demanded instantly:
&#8220;What&#8217;s he done, Bon? Has he been a lickin&#8217;
you? &#8217;Cause&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause why, my lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause he&#8217;d better not! I&#8217;ll lick him back
if he &#8217;tempts it! I studied that out coming
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he doesn&#8217;t &#8216;lick&#8217; me. It would be a
relief if he did. He simply stands and prophesies
evil till I am about distracted. Then I get
mad and long to &#8216;sass&#8217; him&mdash;but don&#8217;t. For a
man who has lived with such a master as long
as he has he is the grumpiest old chap you can
imagine. He seems to be glad to have us here,
thinks &#8216;it&#8217;s a fine thing to have the prop&#8217;ty let,
after lyin&#8217; idle so long, yet is sure it will go to
wrack and ruin bein&#8217; took care of by a passel o&#8217;
young ones an&#8217; one lorn female.&#8217; My goodness!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Here he comes now. Speaking o&#8217; angels, you
know. And what has he brought this time&mdash;but&mdash;a
cat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I always feel a place never can look
homelike without a cat around,&#8221; explained the
visitor, when questioned by Beatrice, &#8220;so I
fetched this one over. She&#8217;s a good mouser,
an&#8217; if you don&#8217;t feed her too much&#8217;ll do well.
H&#8217;m-m. Hope you like the looks o&#8217; things,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Mr. Dolloway, after he had been
brought in and duly presented to Mrs. Beckwith
and Belle. As for Robert, the child&#8217;s presence
was utterly ignored; and finding this the case,
he sauntered out of the room on a tour of private
inspection, or for some reason of his own which
he did not care to mention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do like the looks of things very, very much.
I am sure we shall be very happy here if only our
plans for earning our livelihood do not miscarry.
To-night I feel as rich as a queen in a new
palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. Just keep a feelin&#8217; so, ma&#8217;am. Our
folks are powerful glad you&#8217;ve come, an&#8217; things&#8217;ll
go. But I dunno how they would &#8217;a&#8217; gone if it
hadn&#8217;t been for me looking after these childern
you sent up here. They mean well, but&mdash; My
soul! What in the world!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>The horrible sounds which had interrupted Mr.
Dolloway&#8217;s discourse appeared to come from the
rear of the house, and thither everybody rushed to
learn their cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burglars!&#8221; thought Mrs. Beckwith, trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tramps!&#8221; echoed Isabelle, recalling all the
outrages of that fraternity which she had ever
seen recorded in the newspapers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like some wild animal!&#8221; cried Roland,
and tried to open the door backwards, in his
haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;My soul! It&#8217;s a cat! My&mdash;cat&mdash;I&mdash;believe!&#8221;
exclaimed the visitor, wildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! where is Robert? My little boy&mdash;my
baby!&#8221; wailed the anxious mother, as the sounds
continued, and grew even fiercer.</p>

<p>Where was he, indeed! Till that moment they
had not missed him, but now each face paled with
apprehension as his absence was discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo-row-mur-rrow-screech! -s-spst! Ee-e-yo-ouw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! It&#8217;s my opinion that that sound
and my small brother are connected!&#8221; said
Bonny, composedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if they should be!&#8221; cried Mrs. Beckwith,
now actually sobbing with terror.</p>

<small>ANOTHER LITTLE EPISODE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;EVEN if they should be, we have lived long
enough to know that &#8216;Humpty-Dumpty&#8217;
is all right. He has as many lives as a cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice!&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time they reached the outer kitchen,
whence the terrible sounds proceeded, Robert had
been collared by Mr. Dolloway and was being
shaken violently to and fro, while Roland was
pitifully caressing the cat which their guest had
brought, and which cowered in its rescuer&#8217;s embrace,
hiding its head beneath the friendly arm
and shivering as if in an ague.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dolloway! What are you doing? Can
you and my darling never meet but you must
come to an open battle? It is perfectly scandalous!&#8221;
cried Bonny, indignantly, and taking upon
herself the reproof of the troublesome neighbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, miss! That is what I say! It is a
burning shame and a scandalous outrage! I&#8217;ll
teach him, the little whelp! They&#8217;s a society of
Prevention folks up here, and I&#8217;ll hand <i>his</i> name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
in afore I&#8217;m many days older, or <i>my</i> name ain&#8217;t
spelt John Dolloway!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will&mdash;you&mdash;lemme&mdash;&#8217;lone? I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hereupon Mrs. Beckwith laid her hand upon
the old man&#8217;s arm, and he instantly released his
hold of the unhappy &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, what did you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I jest&mdash;I&mdash;He said&mdash;Oh! oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, my son. Wait till you can collect
yourself, then answer me.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the space of a few seconds the little boy&#8217;s
sobs and moans continued, then he looked up as
brightly as if trouble were a thing unknown.
&#8220;He said they was room to swing a cat, an&#8217; I was
a measurin&#8217; to see how much that was; that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you attempt the measurement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;I held her by the tail an&#8217;
swung her roun&#8217;; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All! Why didn&#8217;t you stop when she yelled
and you saw it hurt her?&#8221; demanded Roland,
severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&#8217;cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I liked ter hear it. It did sound so
funny. I thought I should laugh myself sick&mdash;she
was so mad!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;Robert, go to your room. You know which it
is.&#8221; Mrs. Beckwith&#8217;s voice was stern, and her
small reprobate immediately prepared to obey it,
but unfortunately cast one glance Beatrice-ward,
and changed his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said it was a &#8216;retreat&#8217; when folks was in
a scrape. I&mdash;I bet I&#8217;m in one now; so I&mdash;I&#8217;d
rather go to the peace-room, Motherkin,&#8221; said the
child, sweetly. &#8220;If you are willing, Mother
dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith could not restrain a fleeting
smile, and Roland laughed outright; but the
mother&#8217;s &#8220;no&#8221; had always been &#8220;no,&#8221; with no
sign of wavering about it, and she did not begin
their new life with any lax discipline, much as she
would have so preferred. &#8220;No, Robert. You have
been cruel, and I cannot excuse you. Remain
upstairs until I come to you. Now, Mr. Dolloway,
please accept my sincerest apologies for this
unkindness. I do not seek to lessen my little
boy&#8217;s fault, but if you will trust us and leave the
poor cat here, I am sure I can promise you that
no such maltreatment will ever be given it
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am, I must say you have spoke
like a lady. An&#8217; I hain&#8217;t no wish to be behind-hand
in my neighborliness. But&mdash;though I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
hain&#8217;t no right to mention it, so bein&#8217; &#8217;s you&#8217;re his
mother&mdash;if that there shaver ain&#8217;t born ter be
hung I&#8217;m mistook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you are mistaken. But come into the
dining-room, again, please. I should like to have
you tell me anything you happen to think of
about our new home. I am so great a stranger to
the locality that I am as eager as a child to hear
its history. Will you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am. I guess not. I just
stepped across to say if they was anything any of
us could do for you we was to be notified. Them
was Mr. Brook&#8217;s own words. An&#8217; him an&#8217; her
both hopes you will rest well an&#8217; find things comfortable.
I left a basket of late-keepin&#8217; apples in
the pantry, an&#8217; I make my good evenin&#8217;s to you,
ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door had scarcely closed behind him before
Bonny began to laugh. &#8220;You really must let me
have it out, Motherkin, or I shall be sure to do
it before Bob. That will make him think lightly
of his sin. But now you can foresee how delightfully
the monotony of our existence will be
varied by the &#8216;little episodes&#8217; between that
ancient worthy and our small sinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice, it is really too miserable an occurrence
to jest over.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;But just <i>sub rosa</i> this way. And I warn
you, you are deluded into the impression that
you know your own mind and that you can
manage your own house. But it will be left
for Mr. Dolloway to convince you that you do
not. He takes a lively interest in all his master&#8217;s
schemes, and in us&mdash;his latest&mdash;particularly.
He will be the thorn to this rose, the rod of correction
to our careless lives. Fortunately in this
case not like master is the man. Well, I&#8217;ll
clear away the tea-things now;&#8221; and Beatrice
departed kitchenward to put on a big apron.</p>

<p>Isabelle proffered her assistance, but it was
laughingly declined as &#8220;not available.&#8221; &#8220;No,
dear, not to-night. You&#8217;re company, and I am
in an angelic mood. You&#8217;d better enjoy it while
it lasts; so run out and take another walk with
the &#8216;head of the family,&#8217; whom I see strutting
about over his garden patch as if he were king of
the whole earth. My big brother <i>is</i> a poet; but
he is also a born farmer. He loves the smell of
the soil, and I know it was the making of him to
come up here. He&#8217;d have grown into a disappointed,
narrow-minded tape-seller if he&#8217;d stayed
in town always. Now&mdash;well, I hardly dare tell
you all I foresee in my Roland&#8217;s future!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bonny! hasn&#8217;t all this hard work you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
have been doing taken the enthusiasm out of you
yet? It seems lovely up here, and oh, so peaceful!
But isn&#8217;t it just a bit too quiet and
humdrum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trot along, miss! To-morrow when I hand
over the housekeeping to you the humdrumness
will disappear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;what do you mean, Beatrice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming events cast no shadows before in
this case. When I have finished my dishes,
Mother will be down again with her youngest in
a beatific state of mind, looking as sweet and
innocent as if he had been the sinned against instead
of the sinner; then I&#8217;ll call you and Roland
in, and we&#8217;ll talk over everything and arrange a
fair division of labor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bonny! One would think you had all
the responsibility of this undertaking, to hear
you talk! Isn&#8217;t my mother to have a word of
influence, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is to have all the words she wants, but
none of the work that I can help. Well, I don&#8217;t
mean that exactly; but wait, and I&#8217;ll tell you
what I do mean. Now, trot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus dismissed, Isabelle joined her brother in
the garden. To her, at present, it seemed but a
patch of muddy ground, though to the natural gardener<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
who was to labor in it, it already presented
a picture of thrift and greenness. &#8220;Think of it,
Isabelle Beckwith! A week ago we had not a
fraction of an acre over which to rule, now we
have ten whole ones! I&#8217;m like Motherkin, as
rich as Cr&#339;sus!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we shall get so sick of it. And
we have cut loose now from so much that it
would be hard to get back into even the old,
modest places we held in the city. One never
steps down for a moment but somebody else steps
up into one&#8217;s place. As soon as I told the principal
of our school that I would have to resign
mine, she appointed somebody else at once. I
could not get back the position if I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not look backward, Belle. We
have done what seems the best for all, what
certainly will be the best for our mother&#8217;s health,
and that should cover all regrets. Besides, I am
sure we shall succeed,&mdash;in making a living, at
least. That is all we could have hoped to do if
we had stayed in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Nobody can guess how I
hated to give up my art class! The Professor
said I would certainly make a name for myself if
I kept on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Belle! I did not dream you felt so blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
about this change! And I should like to know
what is to hinder your &#8216;making a name&#8217; for
yourself here as well as there? Don&#8217;t all the
artists, the landscape ones anyway, go into the
country to study? And as for portraits, where
can you find more original models than along
these country lanes? If you have enough rudimentary
knowledge, and talent, to make your
teacher express himself like that, you ought to
be ashamed of yourself if you can&#8217;t conquer the
rest!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. Since when did you become philosopher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. You have always laughed at
my &#8216;poetical talent;&#8217; Bonny has not. But I tell
you that if there is any real poetry in me, so
real that it must find expression, it will find it
here just as certainly as if I were to spend my
days in study and all my evenings scribbling
verses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you disparage education?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin to think there are different sorts of
education. One kind I am going to attempt is
learning the land. I will have to begin at the
A B C of it, just as I did in reading printed
stuff. But the earth is printed, too, and by a
Hand that does nothing in vain. Most boys run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
away from the country because there is no money
in it. I am going to hunt for something which
will beat money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Youth! my brother! Just youth. After
a while I suppose you will find, as old Dolloway
says, that &#8216;money beats sentiment.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and malaria beats both! I&#8217;ve been
warned against too much night-dew, if I want to
keep my health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, isn&#8217;t this a healthful place?&#8221; cried
Isabelle, in quick alarm. &#8220;If it isn&#8217;t we should
never have brought Mother here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is. Mr. Brook is eighty years old, and he
has lived here almost all his life. But he spoke
to me about our being careful, particularly at
first. He said, and truly, that our health is
our capital; and that if we use reasonable precaution
we shall never suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know now that you have grown wise!
I cannot remember when I ever heard you mention
health as a thing to be guarded,&mdash;our health, I
mean. You have been solicitous enough about
Mother&#8217;s, except&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except in what? Don&#8217;t throw cold water on
me now, after warming my vanity like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except when you gave up your situations so
readily, because your &#8216;boss&#8217; &#8216;sassed&#8217; you!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s time to go in, Isabelle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I. I couldn&#8217;t have supported any more
wise remarks! They sound so&mdash;so un-Roland
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! There&#8217;s Bonny calling. Mother and
the &#8216;Hopeful&#8217; have probably come down to the
&#8216;peace-room.&#8217; And, do you know I think that&#8217;s
a mighty pretty fancy of hers? Let&#8217;s try to
please her and remember it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll try; but I&#8217;m not a bit
perfect!&#8221;</p>

<p>Roland forbore the retort that rose to his lip.
Just at present he was still in the first glow of
his incipient manhood, when the idea of being the
&#8220;head of the family&#8221; had a charm of pride and
importance about it that made trifles of heavy
burdens. Isabelle wondered how long his ease-loving
temperament would endure the strain of
actual labor and hardship which would inevitably
be laid upon it; but still, like Beatrice, she saw
a change in Roland, and she could but believe that
he had &#8220;come unto his own&#8221; in coming to dwell
in the wide, beautiful country.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you dreamers! Here have Motherkin
and the bad ones been sitting for full five minutes,
waiting for you to come in. We are to
hold a conclave of forces and decide upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
tactics of this camp! Hi! there! brother Bob!
Does that sound warlike enough for you? I
motion Mother takes the Chair! All in favor&mdash;
Aye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter, I decline all posts purely honorary!
You may be Chairman of the occasion;
for whether we will or no, you will be bound to
have the most to say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Motherkin! But Roland knows, as
well as I, what we have thought. Let him
tell our plans, and if they agree with yours, all
right; if not, we&#8217;ll hear whatever amendments
the house has to offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout?&#8221; asked Robert,
sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Roland, begin, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the money question, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the first expense we shall have to meet
is for garden tools and some sort of a wagon.
Mr. Brook has an old horse for which he has little
use, and he will be glad to have us use it for
a while, and pay him nothing but its keep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, we must try to stand upon our own
feet. We are not to depend upon Mr. Brook as if
<i>we</i> had no independence at all. There is a small
sum of money, you know,&mdash;a few hundred dollars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
We are to use all of it that is necessary in
making this experiment a success. Go on, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As much as is necessary, Motherkin, but no
more. This is no especial benevolence on our
patron&#8217;s part. He is as good and generous as
he can be, but he is also wise. He wants us to
keep our self-respect and his, at the same time.
Well, this way of getting the use of a horse is
quite common among country people. I have inquired
and satisfied myself that it is so. He
hasn&#8217;t a cow to work for its keep, so that we
shall have to buy. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Roland, you are so slow! Listen to me,
Motherkin! I, Beatrice Beckwith, who never
earned a penny in her life&mdash;but once, a flower-girling!&mdash;am
going to be one of the bread-winners!
True, true, true!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bonny! what do you mean? And
how happy you seem!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should think I am happy! Wasn&#8217;t
I the very bottom and beginning of this whole
country business? Didn&#8217;t I go a talking to my
dear old gentleman, and didn&#8217;t he fall in with
the country notion, hot foot? Then it rests on me
to make the thing a &#8216;go;&#8217; and I mean to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It rests upon us all equally, Beatrice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have a situation. I am a private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
secretary, if you please!&mdash;I mean, if you will
please! That was why I was so anxious to
shorten up the music practice and take the other
lessons at the Y. W. C. A. rooms during the last
three months. Mr. Brook divulged the scheme
to me in one of his letters, which you didn&#8217;t
ask to see and I didn&#8217;t offer to show you. And
we have kept it a secret from you on purpose to
be a delightful surprise to you now. I am to have
a dollar a day for my services. Think of that!
I, the harum-scarum, am going to settle down
into a regular money-grubber.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does he need a private secretary?&#8221; demanded
Isabelle, rather anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;To help him put his collection of bugs and
things into shape. You must know that our Mr.
Chidly Brook is a known naturalist,&mdash;the one
whose papers we have liked so much, over the
signature of &#8216;Windsor.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True. He is the most modest of men, though,
and he never speaks of his work as anything but
insignificant. However, he has been appealed to,
on behalf of some museum in Boston, to allow
them to buy his collection when he has done with
it. Of course, he isn&#8217;t going to do that; he will
give it to them, instead; but he is going to put it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
into first-class order first, as if it weren&#8217;t now!
and I am to make catalogues, take down notes,
do anything and everything which will aid him.
Now&mdash;don&#8217;t all speak at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother opened her lips to express her
praise, but her first words were drowned in a
series of knockings as sudden as imperative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rat-a-tat-tat! Tum-tum-tum!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake! Who can be coming to
visit us! At this hour, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when Roland reached the door and opened
it, there was not a person to be seen. The moonlight
fell in a broad sheet across the threshold and
illuminated the sloping lawn before it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rat-a-tat-tat!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sounds came from that side of the house.
There was no doubting that, and Bonny joined
her brother in the search.</p>

<p>But though they tried both front and rear doors,
even the little side porch which led to the eastern
rooms, there was no intruder visible, and they returned
to the place they had left, only to hear the
strange summons repeated almost continually for a
full half-hour; after which, too disturbed to discuss
their plans any further that night, the elder
brother lifted the sleeping Robert from his corner
of the hearth-rug, and followed the rest upstairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>All night, at varying intervals, the uncanny
rappings were repeated, till even the sensible
mother began to feel that there was something
supernatural about them, and to speculate if this
were the reason that the former residents had
found the house unsuitable and vacated it in such
disgust.</p>

<p>But Roland sighed for a gun; and at midnight,
arming himself with a fishing-rod and a broom, he
determined to descend to the &#8220;peace-room&#8221; and
stand guard till morning.</p>

<p>There, presently, the weary lad went sound
asleep; to awake startled by the apparition of a
white-clad figure before him, and to hear the
sibilant whisper, &#8220;How&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;like&mdash;to&mdash;live&mdash;in&mdash;a&mdash;haunted&mdash;house?&#8221;</p>

<small>MISS JOANNA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;OH! did I frighten you? Don&#8217;t&mdash;for
mercy&#8217;s sake! don&#8217;t hit me! Why&mdash;it&#8217;s
I&mdash;Bonny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I should think you might be better
employed! Why didn&#8217;t you stay in your own
room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t sleep. Why didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same reason. Besides, if the household is in
danger I am the one to defend it. Go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the one to help you. Aren&#8217;t you glad
we didn&#8217;t try to sleep over here alone, as we
wanted to? I wonder if Mr. Brook knows anything
about this! He would not allow us, do you
remember? He said we would be more comfortable
at their home, even after we had gotten the
beds set up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think he knew. I am sure if he did
he would have warned us. Hark! There it goes
again! It is&mdash;it certainly is just by that west
door. It sounds as if it came from the earth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;It sounds as if it came from everywhere.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8216;Black spirits and white</div>
<div class="verse">Red spirits and gray&#8217;&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Oh! How my flesh creeps! Isn&#8217;t it a perfectly
delightfully thrilling sensation?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I have had dreams, but not of this,</div>
<div class="verse">That I should share the wondrous bliss</div>
<div class="verse">Of meeting ghostses in the air,</div>
<div class="verse">And have them set on end my hair&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>That last line is rather faulty. It&#8217;s lost a foot or
a leg&mdash; Oh, my! Hark!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is down there with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody. I&#8217;m down here with Roland. The
honor of this exploit is his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up to bed, both of you. You&#8217;ll take
cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! we&#8217;re all gooseflesh now, both of us.
But Roland is dressed, and so am I; that is&mdash;partly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can do nothing about this matter to-night.
I will see Mr. Brook to-morrow and get an explanation.
Else we will make a business of investigation
for ourselves. Come, both of you, at
once.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;Motherkin&#8217;s voice sounds kind of chattery,
too, doesn&#8217;t it? But we had better mind her
promptly. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of going to bed, Mother?
Cannot I sit up?&#8221; pleaded Roland, as he reached
the upper landing of the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be asleep in five minutes, if you
make up your mind to it. The noises have continued
now for some hours, and nobody is the
worse for them. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a rather serious party which gathered
about the breakfast-table, for even to nineteenth-century
folk the idea of living in a &#8220;haunted
house&#8221; had its drawbacks. But as nothing had
been known of the night&#8217;s disturbance by little
Robert, nothing was now mentioned in his presence,
and the talk took up again the interrupted
&#8220;division of labor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roland is to be the farmer, of course. He is to
raise as much as he can in his little greenhouse,
or cold frame it will be this spring. Oh! I forgot,
I didn&#8217;t mean to tell his part for him. Fire
ahead yourself, Roland!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a young lady who has been promoted to
a private secretaryship, you are not over-choice in
your language, Beatrice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Motherkin, I&#8217;ll try. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
seems so long to wait before you know all we
have thought out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Roland, &#8220;our friends think I can
sell a good deal of green stuff. Mr. Brook has
lent me lots of books on &#8216;gardening for profit,&#8217;
and his gardener has told me more. He, the
gardener, has offered to teach me by overseeing
my work, and I shall be very grateful to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a cranky old soul, Mother. I wonder
Roland has the patience to endure his &#8216;you
musts&#8217; and &#8216;you must nots;&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I should expect little endurance from
you&mdash;in the patience line, my daughter. That&#8217;s
your rock of stumbling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind, Mother. I&#8217;m going to
blast it out of the way with the dynamite of
hard work. See if I don&#8217;t! Proceed, Roland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Joanna says that in such a busy household
even the youngest is sure to want to do
something; so what do you think she has planned
for you, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. I&mdash;I ain&#8217;t sufferin&#8217; ter do no work.
I&mdash;I&#8217;d rather fish an&#8217; go swimmin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but this is a co-operative establishment.
Every member must contribute something
to the general support. Your share is to
be&mdash;eggs!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;Eggs! I ain&#8217;t no hen. I can&#8217;t lay no eggs,
can I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can study grammar and take care of
poultry at the same time. Miss Brook has a
famous stock of poultry. It is one of her amusements;
but she is going to start you off with a
few ordinary fowls, and see how you manage
them. Then, if you are industrious, after you
have paid for the first ones, she will let you have
a better lot. I am to repair the old poultry-house,
down at the foot of the barnyard, and
you are to do the rest. I suppose, at first, mother
would be as willing to buy her eggs and chickens
of you as of anybody else. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say&mdash;I say&mdash;I dunno. I&mdash;well, I guess
I&#8217;ll let her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, &#8216;Humpty-Dump&#8217;! It just begins to
dawn upon me that you are a spoiled child. Mr.
Dolloway has remarked so several times, and I
have indignantly denied it. I hope you will be a
little gentleman to Miss Brook, no matter whether
your business ideas differ from hers or not. She
is coming here very soon, and I don&#8217;t want her to
think my Bob is anything less perfect than I have
painted him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m. Don&#8217;t that Mr. Dolloway man live to
her house?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;Yes; certainly. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they ain&#8217;t no use. He&#8217;s told her the
hull cat an&#8217; checker-board story &#8217;fore this time.
I guess I won&#8217;t need to bother an&#8217; behave no
diff&#8217;runt from every day. She wouldn&#8217;t believe
me if I did. She&#8217;d be a &#8217;spectin&#8217; I&#8217;d do somethin&#8217;
naughty all the time. She wouldn&#8217;t have
no conf&#8217;dunce in a feller after that man has
talked to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Is that all the courage you have? If
I were you I&#8217;d show her that the old gentleman
was mistaken. I&#8217;d take her chickens an&#8217; say,
&#8216;Thank you.&#8217; I&#8217;d set every mother biddy on a
pile of fresh eggs, and I&#8217;d have little downy
chickens running all around. I&#8217;d teach the
hens to respect me and come to me every time
I called them; and I&#8217;d make my Motherkin
think she had the smartest little boy in Orange
County, which is where you live now, my
dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it? Would you, Bon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull&mdash;wull&mdash;I guess you&#8217;re &#8217;most always
square. An&#8217; I will. I&#8217;ll let Miss Brook be good
ter me if she wants ter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Magnanimous soul! Now, Isabelle. I&mdash;I
dread to glance your way.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Why? I thought that Roland was going to
tell us the rest of the planning. You are a great
monopolist, Bonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am silent; I say no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Roland? What is my share?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to be housekeeper. To stay with
mother and take the home-work from her
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment of really anxious waiting.
&#8220;Bonny has always been the house-worker,&#8221; said
the elder girl, at length. &#8220;Why should she not
continue and let me go as secretary to Mr. Brook?
I took a course of typewriting before she did, if
you&#8217;ll remember. I don&#8217;t like housework, and I
shall make a botch of it. I shall worry mother
more than help her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could do both!&#8221; cried Beatrice, with
her impulsive generosity. &#8220;And I can, some of
it. You hate dish-washing the worst of any part.
Well, leave the dishes till I get home at night and
I will do them then. So you can get more time
for your painting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith said nothing. She waited to let
the two settle the matter between themselves if
they could; but she was quite ready with the
decisive word should it need to be spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we must be more fair than that. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
you do the housework I must do the writing; or
<i>vice versa</i>. I do not see what difference it makes,
why he should mind the change; and you keep
mother in better spirits than I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny opened her lips, blushed, and said nothing.
Yet Roland came to her aid very promptly.
He loved both of his sisters better than many
lads would have been willing to confess, but
Bonny was his other self. Though they were
always bandying jests with each other, they had
never had a really angry word. Isabelle, while
being far more ladylike and quiet, was also much
more selfish; and Roland had suffered from this
fault of hers more than once. He was not sorry,
therefore, to be able to defend his favorite and
discipline Belle at the same time. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you
what difference it makes. Mr. Brook loves
Bonny best. Yes, he has told me that he really
loves her. They have a community of tastes.
You know she was always fond of studying natural
history when she had a chance, and when
people are <i>en rapport</i> it makes everything else
easy. With you it would be a real task for him
to dictate and direct. It would be just as hard
for you. But with Bonny it will seem almost like
play,&mdash;to him, at least. I only hope he won&#8217;t
keep my sister too long at her work. He may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
forget that she is not as enthusiastic as himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; began Isabelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;Mr. Brook has made his own choice.
We owe him for much kindness. There is nothing
more to be said about it,&#8221; said Mrs. Beckwith,
rising. &#8220;Here comes a lady walking. Is it your
&#8216;Miss Joanna,&#8217; children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, oh! yes! Look at her, before she
spies us watching. Isn&#8217;t she a sweet old lady?
Isn&#8217;t she the lady of your chrysanthemum
dream?&#8221;</p>

<p>Over the lawn where the grass was just springing
into greenness came the tall, graceful figure,
which despite its seventy-odd years was still as
straight as Isabelle&#8217;s, who, looking curiously, remembered
her brother&#8217;s words of the evening
before, &#8220;If you want models, where can you find
them better than here?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ah! indeed, Miss Joanna would be a model fit
to inspire a genius! Her face was like the tint of
a late blush rose, frost-faded. Her eyes were
dark, her mouth firm and sweet, and her snowy
hair, parted on either side her temples, framed
them in silver. On her head she wore a big
gray hat, tied primly under her chin, and over
the soft gray morning-gown a shawl of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
neutral tint, which clothed&mdash;not hung upon&mdash;her
shoulders. But it was the expression of her
countenance that captivated them all, even the
matter-of-fact Robert.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Wull, be you the egg woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mindful of past advice, the youngster slipped
down from his place, set the door wide, and
advancing held out his crumby hand. &#8220;Wull,
be you the egg woman? I&#8217;m very glad to see
you. Come right in. We&#8217;ve just done eatin&#8217;
breakfas&#8217;. This is Motherkin, an&#8217; these is the
rest of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Robert! No need to tell me that!&#8221;
responded the visitor, smiling, and not refusing
the proffered handshake, though she looked regretfully
at her soiled glove the second afterward.
&#8220;I have heard of you, and the pleasure of
acquaintance is mutual. Good-morning, Mrs.
Beckwith&mdash;Isabelle&mdash;Roland, and my girl. I
hope you have rested well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning. Will you sit down here, or
come into the other room? My Beatrice has
scarcely told us which is &#8216;best-room&#8217; as yet.
They all seem so fine and comfortable to
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that. I was afraid you might
find them small; but it does indeed look very
bright and cheery. Anywhere; here, if you like.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
We are so very glad to have you for neighbors, I
could not defer any longer to come and bid you
welcome. Does the house please you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It pleases me perfectly. But, since you ask
if we rested well, I must tell you our strange
experience;&#8221; and she very briefly narrated the
unaccountable knockings.</p>

<p>Miss Brook listened curiously, with the utmost
astonishment depicted on her countenance. The
current of her thoughts was not particularly flattering
to Mrs. Beckwith&#8217;s common-sense, had it
been known, but of course it was not; nor did
anybody observe the interest with which Robert
received his first intimation of what had occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have never heard anything like it,
and, of a certainty, it must have some rational
explanation. What that may be we will find as
soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Brook, do let us believe it&#8217;s
haunted!&#8221; cried Bonny, coaxingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s so
delightful and uncommon in America. I feel
just like a heroine this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like one, my dear, with those shining
eyes and pink cheeks. You may be tired,
but you are physically better than when you
came a week ago. But ghosts! Oh, no! we
have no ghosts in New Windsor.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;Still they&#8217;re so inspiring!&#8221; said Bonny, with
a comical glance at Roland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear Miss Joanna, will you believe that
my matter-of-fact sister came down into the
dining-room in the middle of the night, listened
to the &#8216;rappings,&#8217; and immediately burst into
rhyme? Shall I repeat, Beatrice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the peril of your life! Beg pardon, Miss
Brook. I will not talk any more, at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to hear you, my child, I like to hear
you. It does old ears good to listen to youthful
chatter. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s better than hearing much
that is said which may be more sensible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody smiled, Bonny most demurely; and
the mother understood at once what was the
bond of sympathy between these two bright
maidens,&mdash;one at the end of life, the other at
its beginning. &#8220;I think, my dear, that you have
been charmingly answered. But, Miss Brook,
what do you imagine to be the cause of our
disturbance? Have you any theory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, none. I am not a theoretical person.
I leave all that to my brother. However, I&#8217;ll
send a man over to help Roland look about.
Master Robert, I suppose that your brother has
mentioned to you my plan for your helping the
others of this self-helpful family, has he not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;What, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; asked the little boy, quite at
a loss to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I forget! I am not used to talking with
small people. Has Roland told you about the
hens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8217;m. When can I have &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as soon as the poultry-house is repaired,
and the pickets on the fence. It will not do for
them to run about anywhere they please, for that
would be to ruin this fine garden that is to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are few seeds in it yet, Miss Brook.
Will it make any difference so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my farmer. If the hens are not trained
as they should be in the beginning, they will certainly
go astray; in which they are exactly like
little boys&mdash;and gray-haired girls,&#8221; said Miss
Joanna, smiling down upon the small lad, who
had remained close beside her from the moment
of her arrival, but who seemed neither to disturb
her nor to wish to do so; which, to his family,
was inexplicable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go see how much will have to be &#8217;paired.
Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure, if your mother is willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she don&#8217;t care, do you, Motherkin? &#8217;ness
we break our necks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not intend to break mine. I haven&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
done with it yet,&#8221; returned Miss Brook gayly,
and left the house with her crisp, clean step, that
somehow made Beatrice think of everything pure
and sweet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she lovely, Mother? Here, let me get
your bonnet and you go with them. It will be
safer, on Bob&#8217;s account, and you are to begin this
very morning to take the doctor&#8217;s prescription,
&#8216;Live out of doors all that you can.&#8217; Here is a
hat, dear,&mdash;no matter if it is mine; and I declare
you are almost as pretty as&mdash;Miss Joanna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sauce-box! You deserve that I should
not kiss you! But I will. How delightful the
air is! How good it is to be here!&#8221; Mrs. Beckwith&#8217;s
careworn face lighted with glad thanksgiving,
and with a wave of her hand to her
daughters on the wide porch she stepped briskly
down the path her guest had followed.</p>

<p>But she had not gone more than a dozen yards
when her feet were arrested by Robert&#8217;s shrill
cry; a cry of such distress and fear that her
heart stood still in dread. Then, mindless of
physician&#8217;s orders, she bounded forward frantically.
&#8220;The river&mdash;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s drowned!&#8221;</p>

<small>BITS OF NATURAL HISTORY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;ROBERT! where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H-he-re, Moth-er!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8221; proved to be upon the sloping roof of
the little poultry-house, where the child looked
safe and rather ridiculous in his fright; and relieved
of one anxiety, Mrs. Beckwith passed
through the building toward the yard beyond in
pursuit of Miss Brook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snakes! That&#8217;s all. A nest of black snakes.
I&#8217;m trying to kill them.&#8221; Miss Joanna was,
indeed, laying about her lustily with a heavy
stick she had seized, and her delicate face was
flushed with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;ll bite you! My dear madam, do
come away!&#8221; Poor Mrs. Beckwith herself was
thrilled with fear, as her eyes fell upon the tangle
of writhing, sinuous creatures to whom her neighbor
was dealing destruction so vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, indeed! Not until I have made an
end of them! Robby was terribly frightened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
though he had no cause to be. I&#8217;ve finished two,
I&#8217;ll have done presently. There! don&#8217;t let that
one get away, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>The reptile was crawling sluggishly toward the
spot where Mrs. Beckwith stood, and, with a
scream that closely resembled her son&#8217;s, she leaped
aside and retreated through the doorway.</p>

<p>Miss Joanna looked up in unfeigned surprise,
and for a moment relaxed her murderous labor.
&#8220;Why, are you afraid of these creatures?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Af-ra-id! Of course&mdash;I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are harmless. You need not be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harmless! Why, then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I destroy them? My statement must be
qualified. They can hurt no person and they are
timid; but they infest poultry-houses, steal eggs,
make trouble in the dairy, and altogether accomplish
so much more injury than benefit to a household
that I think them best dead. My brother
would not agree with me. He says they pay for
their depredations by ridding us of meaner creatures.
He would be quite distressed at my present
action; only&mdash;&#8221; And the lady laughed lightly.
&#8220;He has already as large a collection of reptiles
as he should have. The sight of them terrifies
nearly everybody, as these have you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The city woman could scarce believe her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
ears; that anybody occupied as Miss Brook was
at that moment could go on complacently giving
a dissertation on the merits and demerits of so
obnoxious an animal was amazing. Finally she
found voice to inquire, &#8220;Are they plentiful hereabout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! yes. But these are the first I have seen
this spring,&#8221; answered Miss Joanna, cheerfully.
&#8220;I am always glad for one reason to meet my
first snake. I&#8217;m pretty sure of warm weather
coming. These have just crawled out of their
winter quarters, somewhere near, and have been
sunning themselves in this shallow pool of water.
If they had been in usual activity, I should have
had a chase to capture them. Poor things!
that&#8217;s the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be they all dead, every single one?&#8221; demanded
Robert from his slippery perch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so; you can come down now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did so rather gingerly, lifting his feet very
high when he stepped upon the moist earth of the
poultry yard, and almost expecting to see a small
head arise beneath his every footprint. &#8220;You&#8217;re
a awful funny lady, Miss Brook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so, dear?&#8221; asked that person, continuing
her examination of the place and mentally
determining the cost of the needed repairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Cause you&#8217;re sorry for things, yet you keep
on a killin&#8217; &#8217;em, an&#8217; &#8217;cause you ain&#8217;t afraid of
snakes. I never saw any before, &#8217;cept up to the
park, in the menagerie. I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; He paused,
looked anxiously toward his mother, thrust his
hands in his pockets, turned quite red in the face,
and finally blurted out: &#8220;I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to keep
no hen things, I ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Robert!&#8221; and &#8220;Why, Robert?&#8221; fell
from both women&#8217;s lips at the same instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8217;cause, I&mdash;I know it sounds
awful cowardy, but I don&#8217;t like snakes, an&#8217; there
ain&#8217;t no use pertendin&#8217; I do. I wouldn&#8217;t dast to
come here alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible! The boy who boasts he is
afraid of nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull&mdash;wull&mdash;you see. Why, Mother,
you&#8217;re afraid yourself! You must know how it
seems. If one should bite your little boy, how
dretful bad you&#8217;d feel! Wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I should. But Miss Brook has just
told us that these snakes are harmless. And I
am not a boy. I&#8217;m only a woman, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Wull&mdash;I&mdash;I s&#8217;pose I will. I
said I would, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t a goin&#8217; to lie, nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is right! That is fine!&#8221; cried Miss
Joanna, impulsively. &#8220;A little lad who has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
love of the truth so strong that it will overcome
personal fear is the sort of boy for me!&#8221; Then
she went on to explain so clearly to the child all
the habits of the hated reptiles now lying dead in
the yard of Robert&#8217;s &#8220;own poultry-house&#8221; that
he became intensely interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, if a snake, just a nasty black snake,
has got such a lot of int&#8217;rusting things about it,
I s&#8217;pose rabbits an&#8217; such fellers must have a heap
more. Don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say they did! And you must ask
my brother all about any sort of living creature
you wish to become acquainted with, and he will
be delighted to tell you. He is a very wise man,
for all he is so quiet about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he know &#8217;bout hens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything, I fancy, though he likes snakes
better. Wild things are more to his notion than
tame ones. Now I am ready to tell your big
brother just what must be done here, and if he
can manage to get the place fixed to-day you can
begin your poultry business to-morrow. Now is
just the time to make a pleasant and profitable
commencement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it is &#8216;sitting time.&#8217; Every mother
biddy in the flock, or nearly every one, is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
thinking about her coming family, and wanting
to &#8216;sit.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does hens think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, you must not tire Miss Brook with
your questions. Ask some of us, who understand
you better; and we will try to answer, as wisely
as we know, though I begin to think our ignorance
is mountainous, about country life at
least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; I beg, dear Mrs. Beckwith! Don&#8217;t
discourage inquisitiveness of this sort, not on
my account. I am a lonely old woman who will
be as glad to answer questions as a genuine boy
is to ask them. I like it, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother smiled gratefully. As for Robert,
he slipped his hand again into his new friend&#8217;s,
and looked up into her face encouragingly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a nice lady! And I&#8217;ll be good; I&#8217;ll
ask you every single thing I can think of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before that summer was over it seemed to
poor Miss Joanna that he had fully redeemed
his word; and yet the days on which this living
interrogation point was out of her sight grew to
be the loneliest days the gentle old lady knew.</p>

<p>Mr. Brook was as much at a loss to understand
the mysterious rappings that had so disturbed his
new tenants&#8217; peace during their first night at The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Lindens, as was anybody else; but he set himself
to examine every part of the house and grounds,
and, like his sister, declared his faith in a rational
explanation of the occurrence.</p>

<p>It was left to Mr. Dolloway to solve the riddle.
He had, to Mrs. Beckwith&#8217;s relief and Robert&#8217;s
disgust, declared his intention of passing the following
night in the old house, and, should the
disturbing noises be repeated, searching for the
cause till he found it. In his own words: &#8220;I&#8217;ll
find the spirits or I&#8217;ll be a spirit myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds large and reassuring, doesn&#8217;t
it!&#8221; remarked Bonny to Belle. &#8220;I can imagine
Mr. Dolloway in the condition of hunger necessary
to make him &#8216;spiritual.&#8217; For his sake
and our own, I hope success will crown his efforts
before he gets to the verge of starvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The evening passed without any &#8220;manifestations.&#8221;
Roland twanged his banjo for the amusement
of their self-invited guest, Isabelle brought
out her portfolio of drawings, Beatrice made character
sketches of the different persons present, and
so aptly that Robert remained in a hilarious condition
that precluded his feeling any of the fear
he had expected; and by nine o&#8217;clock, tired out
with another day of &#8220;settling,&#8221; the whole family
retired to their chambers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Save and except Mr. Dolloway. &#8220;I will not
lie down nor shut an eye, lad; there isn&#8217;t any
use of urging me. I&#8217;ve come over here to ferret
out this thing, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll ferret it wide awake an&#8217;
dressed.&#8221; With that he settled himself in the
most comfortable chair in the room, put his feet
upon the fender, and in five minutes was sound
asleep.</p>

<p>Bonny heard his snores as she lay awake in
her bed, and laughed; then she heard something
which did not add to her mirth. She had brought
the kitchen poker with her, and, armed thus
valiantly, she rose and summoned Roland. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
be as still as mice, I think the rest are all asleep,
and we&#8217;ll steal a march on them and Brother
Dolloway as well. Listen to him, will you? he
quite out-rackets the &#8216;spirits.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith silently joined the company, and
when the three met on the stairs, each expressed
surprise that the other had not gone quietly to
sleep as usual, and each was attired exactly as
during the day. Mrs. Beckwith bore the traditional
weapon of womankind, a broom; and when
Belle added her presence to the others, she was
likewise equipped.</p>

<p>At the door of the sitting-room somebody
dropped her article of defence with such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
clatter that Mr. Dolloway sprang from his chair,
angrily demanding: &#8220;What in the world do
you mean coming into a man&#8217;s room in this
way, without warning?&#8221; Then recollecting himself,
he laughed at his own blunder, and changed
his question to, &#8220;Why did you get up when there
has been no rapping?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, excuse me, there has been rapping,
even louder than last night,&#8221; responded
Beatrice, shivering a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Haven&#8217;t I been here all the
time? If the thumps had come don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose
I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; heard &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly you fell asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fell asleep! H&#8217;m-m. When I set out to
watch, I watch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rat-a-tat, a-tat! The unseen disturbers of the
peace interfered to prevent any further misunderstanding
between the volunteer protector and the
protected.</p>

<p>Mr. Dolloway held up his hand for silence.
Again the sounds were repeated, this time with
redoubled force it seemed to the strained ears of
the listeners.</p>

<p>The next they knew the old man was back in
his arm-chair, laughing violently and swaying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and fro in his paroxysm of mirth. &#8220;Ha, ha, ha!
That&#8217;s the best joke I ever heard, the very
best. And to think Mr. Brook himself didn&#8217;t
guess at it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know? Hark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Beckwith began to lose patience
with what seemed to her ill-timed mirth, and
replied with conviction, &#8220;Of course we do not
know or we should have disturbed nobody to
inform us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, ma&#8217;am. I really s&#8217;pose you don&#8217;t
know, bein&#8217; brought up in the city, so to speak.
Well, ma&#8217;am, my opinion o&#8217; them sounds is: what
master would call <i>mephitis</i>, what common folks
name&mdash;skunks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody said anything for a moment; and seeing
the look of astonishment upon the faces about
him, as well as hearing the &#8220;thump, thump,&#8221;
continued, Mr. Dolloway explained: &#8220;The <i>mephitis</i>&mdash;I
learn my names from Mr. Brook, because
he says the other ones are &#8216;local,&#8217; an&#8217; not spoke
everywhere,&mdash;the <i>mephitis</i> is a burrowin&#8217; animal.
They was a nest of snakes woke up in the hen-yard,
Miss Brook told me this morning, and
they&#8217;s a nest of the other fellows woke up under
your door-sill, or, maybe, under that big flat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
stun used for a step. The noise is made by their
tails a flap-flap-flapping against the hard ground
or sunthin&#8217;. They won&#8217;t do any harm there till
morning, and then I&#8217;ll get the men to have &#8217;em
rousted out. They&#8217;ll have to be shot; an&#8217; now
you all might as well go to bed again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will not you go upstairs, too, Mr. Dolloway?
There is an extra room, you know; and I should
feel proud to be able to entertain anybody over
night, after having to economize space as I did
in our &#8216;flat.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The guest consented, and everybody was soon
asleep, satisfied that Mr. Dolloway&#8217;s explanation
was probably the correct one, unromantic as it
proved to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think my &#8216;haunt&#8217; turned out to be so
perfectly horrid! It&#8217;s cured me of superstition,
anyway!&#8221; sighed Beatrice, as she kissed her
mother good-night. &#8220;One by one my dreams
forsake me; one by one&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d best get to bed as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Motherkin! not even poetry allowed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at this hour of the night, for working
girls.&#8221; And the candle was blown out.</p>

<small>GETTING DOWN TO REALITIES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WELL, Mother dear, I&#8217;m off! Please
wish me good luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you patience and wisdom. These will
bring the only sort of &#8216;luck&#8217; worth having.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I dread it so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Beatrice! Dread beginning your work
for Mr. Brook? I thought you were very happy
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am, in one way. I love him dearly
already, I do, indeed. That is why I shall feel
so anxious to please him exactly; and since I
have been with him more I find he is rather&mdash;well,
sort of&mdash;um-m&mdash;particular, you know!
And I&mdash;I never could do anything alike twice.
I&#8217;m excellent for spurts of energy and hap-hazard
industry, but the regular, day-after-day, early-in-the-morning,
late-at-night kind is what will try
my soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Isabelle is grieving herself half-sick over
the &#8216;drudgery&#8217; of housework! After all, I wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
that our good friend had not been quite so explicit
in his desires; for you don&#8217;t object to what
tries Belle&#8217;s spirits, and she could do the mechanical
part of your labor as well as you; the typewriting
and note-taking, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear, it can&#8217;t be helped. Even you, I
fancy, don&#8217;t find country housekeeping quite a
picnic. It&#8217;s so much easier to run to the corner
bakery for a loaf of bread than to make it one&#8217;s
self. Oh! your girl has seen that wrinkly look
come on your face, Motherkin, lots of times during
this last week; and&mdash; Dear, are you sorry we
came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&mdash;no, indeed! Not in the least. I am
foolishly sorry that I cannot make everything
smooth for you all. It is up-hill work getting
into a settled way of living; but the Beckwiths
&#8216;never say die,&#8217; and a little more patience is all
any of us need, except Roland. He, it seems to
me, is in no want of more. He is an example to
me, and a revelation. He, certainly, has found
his right place; and it should be all the reward
any of his womenkind could desire to know that.
I never saw a love of the country and all appertaining
to it so marked in anybody. Listen to him now,
whistling away! He has broken his plough; but
instead of losing his temper over it he has gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
to work to &#8216;tinker&#8217; it up the best he can. And
his poor hands, unused to manual labor, are blistered
so that it must give him physical pain every
time he touches anything. Oh, no, I cannot be
sorry that we came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless the dear old Laureate! I&#8217;ll pattern
after him if I can. But&mdash;it isn&#8217;t all rose-color,
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down here one moment; you have five to
spare. I want to remind you that though our
Mr. Brook is so delightful and seems so young,
he is still an old, old man. Be very gentle with
him, even if he should get impatient and say
sharp things to you. I do not know that he
will; I only suggest what is liable to happen.
Will you try to put your own impatience out of
the question, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it at home with you, Motherkin.
I&#8217;ll be perfectly angelic, if I can. And I&#8217;m
going to say, &#8216;A dollar a day, six dollars a
week!&#8217; to myself, continually. That&#8217;s going to
be my rock of salvation, Motherkin! Six dollars
a week for a whole year will be over three hundred
dollars toward our home! And we&#8217;re all agreed
on that. We all look forward to the day when
we can go to Mr. Brook and say, &#8216;Please, sir,
we&#8217;d like to buy The Lindens!&#8217; Oh! I&#8217;m not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
afraid now; and I&#8217;m getting as mercenary as a
Jew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! No comparisons. And I foresee that
the money part will soon be the last in your mind
as connected with your labor. However, time&#8217;s
up! Off with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment more, Motherkin. What are
you doing with that thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a rude little frame I tacked together to
fade some embroidery silk upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fade silk? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I have none of the right shade for
the work I have in hand; so the sunshine is to
help me out. I will wind the threads from these
spools about the frame, then place it in the sunshine&mdash;by
that south window, I think&mdash;till it
pales to the right tint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! If I could only run into the art store
and buy you the right sort without all this
trouble!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have this fine light for my task
than anything out of the art store, dearie. And
I am so much stronger than when I came, a week
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really stronger, Motherkin darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really stronger, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s glorious! Away goes my silly regret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
for the things that were! And that thought will
make me able to laugh inside, if I dare not outside,
should my &#8216;master&#8217; seem stern or hard to
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go to the opposite extreme. Mr.
Brook will never be harsh, or even &#8216;stern,&#8217; I
fancy, with you. But your ignorance concerning
what is so simple to him may try his patience.
That&#8217;s all. Now I must go to Belle. Have you
seen Robert lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not since breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very quiet somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then of course he&#8217;s in mischief. But he&#8217;ll
come out all right; he always does, you know.
Good-by.&#8221; Off she ran, trilling in her rich young
voice the first bars of &#8220;Edinboro Toon;&#8221; and
Mrs. Beckwith rose with a smile to seek her other,
less light-hearted daughter.</p>

<p>Belle stood over the kitchen sink, her sleeves
pushed above elbows far too white and dainty, as
she herself thought, to be plunged in a deep pan
of hot suds, and with a &#8220;mop&#8221; was trying to
wash the morning&#8217;s cups and saucers without
touching her hands to the detested water. Her
expression was so lugubrious that, despite a sincere
sympathy, the mother could scarce repress
a smile, and the girl faced about just in time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
catch the amused expression and to guess at its
cause. A sudden burst of tears followed, and
Mrs. Beckwith was at her daughter&#8217;s side
instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor, misguided child! Don&#8217;t, I beg of
you, allow yourself to weep over&mdash;a pan of
soiled dishes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As Bonny would say, I&#8217;ll spoil the water!
Is that it, Mother?&#8221; cried Belle, beginning to
laugh almost hysterically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it is so unworthy of you, my artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Artist! This looks like it, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly like it. It is your very finely strung
nature which makes these trivial trials so distasteful
to you. It isn&#8217;t laziness or selfishness or
vanity; no, I am sure it is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle dropped the wooden-handled dish-cloth
with a splash, and gazed at her mother in astonishment.
&#8220;Why&mdash;Mother! Did&mdash;you&mdash;think
it was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, darling, I did not. Others might think
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Motherkin, I&mdash;hate it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must kill the hatred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t; it&#8217;s born in me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, it is the fault of my mistaken
training.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;No, no, no. Please don&#8217;t say that. I am
ashamed of it, but I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl who has the talent, nay, more, the
genius, that you have is too strong a person to say
that, mentally too strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, if I am talented, as you flatter me
by saying&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never flatter, dear. Flattery is untruth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I have talent isn&#8217;t it wasted here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not. I have never had patience with
the theory that geniuses should be exempt from
the general burdens of life. The greater the intelligence
the greater the endurance and courage
should be. I don&#8217;t believe the dear Lord ever
made a nature lop-sided; though there are so
many lop-sided folks in the world, it sometimes
seems so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what you mean, Mother. I don&#8217;t
want to be a kill-joy in the family, but I felt
five minutes ago as if I were ready to give up
life, if it were to be all&mdash;housework!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith began unwinding her spools of
silk and rewinding them on her rude frame preparatory
to the bleaching process, and Isabelle
watched her curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is this way. A body has one
characteristic more marked than another; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
straightway his or her mistaken friends set about
developing it to the detriment of all the other
characteristics, which being less pronounced are
left without training and cultivation till they
really become insignificant. We were in danger
of just that for you, but dish-washing happened
in time to prevent. That &#8216;hated&#8217; task will make
you a symmetrical and noble woman, my Belle,
mentally, as you bid fair to become physically.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, you are the dearest, oddest little
reasoner in the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. But let&#8217;s look at this matter
practically. Is there not some way by which
you can lessen the distastefulness of your task?
Can you not study nature, landscape &#8216;effects,&#8217;
at the same time, or learn something of your
favorite authors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no way. That is why&mdash;one why&mdash;it
is disagreeable. I am here in the midst of a
lovely country, but if I do the housework as it
should be, as Miss Brook assures me it should be,
I shall have no time for anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go again, twisting your mind
out of balance toward the other side. If I were
you, I would certainly combine art with dish-washing
and literature with my other domestic
duties. You can, easily.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;Please tell me,&#8221; begged Isabelle, now interested
and smiling, and in this new mood forgetting
to take account of her hands otherwise than
that they fulfilled their present task well.</p>

<p>&#8220;That window over the sink looks out upon as
lovely a bit of country as God ever made. Now,
suppose you take a large sheet of wrapping-paper
and cover the lower sash before which you stand,
leaving out the size of one pane. Then through
that loop-hole, as it were, do your studying. Take
the foliage, as it expands. Note the different
tones and shades of green; the forms of the
young buds, their manner of growth from the
first appearing to the full perfection. It seems
to me that will give you a knowledge of detail
which will help you wonderfully in your &#8216;technique&#8217;
when you come to put your brush to
canvas. So with the cloud and sky tints; they
are never-ending in variety. I would keep a
little note-book beside me and jot down the
colors your studies suggest to you; then when
you have leisure verify these suggestions by
actual trial. You can vary your outlook continually,
and I think you will become so interested
in the experiment that you will acquire
the other knowledge&mdash;of how to despatch the
dish-washing neatly and rapidly&mdash;without thinking
much about it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Belle mused for a few moments; her face softening
under the conviction that she would not thus
be debarred from all connection with the one sort
of labor she had heretofore loved. Then she
asked: &#8220;You said literature, too. How can I
read while about the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This way. Have a wide piece sewn across
the bottom of your gingham aprons, with pockets
stitched in it; and in these pockets carry one of
your &#8216;Handy Volume&#8217; series or one of your art
&#8216;Primers.&#8217; Take out your book from time to
time and memorize anything which pleases you.
You can thus, if you choose, gain more actual
understanding of the world&#8217;s best minds during
one dinner-getting than during a class-hour at
school. I know; I&#8217;ve tried it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother! is that the way you came to
know so many of the poets by heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dearie, the very way. And the knowledge
has been &#8216;meat and drink&#8217; to me many and many
a time. When you were all small, and my darkest
hours were upon me, I had to get right straight
out of myself to enable me just to live. If I had
dwelt upon my own hardships, I should have
broken down physically long ago. But I just
wouldn&#8217;t. I said to these sweet singers and
teachers: &#8216;You must bear my burdens for me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
God made you stronger than He made me, and
I shall utilize you!&#8217; The beauty of it was that
they did support me, and lost no whit of
strength themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My set of poets is so nicely bound. They
were my prizes at school, you know. If I had a
cheaper edition&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling, would you rather have a white book
or a white soul?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Motherkin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which?&#8221; asked Mrs. Beckwith, persistently,
gently winding at her bits of skeins.</p>

<p>&#8220;The soul, of course. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I thought so. If I had an <i>edition
de luxe</i>, even, of any author who had words of
cheer for me, I would not hesitate to put it to the
use I have suggested,&mdash;not for the twentieth part
of a second. Oh! I could groan sometimes, over
the books that are wasted by lying on library
shelves unread, when there are so many hungry
minds going unfed through life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith had waxed enthusiastic, as was
her wont when books were her subject; but she
had succeeded in banishing the dolorous expression
from her daughter&#8217;s face and the forebodings
which had troubled her from her own mind. She
rose and fastened her stretcher of silken thread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
in the southern window, and then she went out,
remarking: &#8220;It is time I looked after Robert.
He has been ominously quiet ever since breakfast-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sought him in the poultry-house, where,
despite his fear of snakes, he passed much of his
time watching the sitting hens with which Miss
Brook had stocked his establishment. He repaired
thither each morning with a firm belief
that nature must work a miracle on his behalf,
and that the ordinary three weeks of time required
to change eggs into chickens would be
shortened to one, &#8220;&#8217;cause no little boy ever wanted
chicks so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert!&#8221; called the mother, entering the
little house.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder, would he disobey me and go fishing
or swimming after he had promised not!&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the prospective mother biddies clucked
loudly as if to suggest, &#8220;No strangers allowed!&#8221;
and Mrs. Beckwith retreated.</p>

<p>Just outside the yard she met Mr. Dolloway.
&#8220;Good-morning, ma&#8217;am. Where&#8217;s that boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for him now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! I came to tell him he&#8217;d probably
addled all them eggs a handling &#8217;em so much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
and I&#8217;d brought him a few fresh ones. Yesterday
he took a whole nest full and punched a pin-hole
in &#8217;em, to see the chicks inside. He&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s
a great one!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolloway&#8217;s tone betokened more amusement
than anger, and Mrs. Beckwith eagerly exclaimed:
&#8220;I was sure you would like my little
son, after you understood him thoroughly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! I defy anybody to do that, ma&#8217;am,&mdash;understand
him, begging your pardon for my
freedom. Ho&mdash;hello! What&mdash;what&mdash; Look
yonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother wheeled about anxiously, and followed
her neighbor&#8217;s gaze houseward. There on
the ridge-pole of the old roof sat the lad they
sought. The house was three stories high in one
part, but sloped downward to within a few feet
of the ground on the &#8220;Revolutionary&#8221; side, after
the fashion of buildings of that period. This
long slope of roof was on the north, and almost
directly below the eaves was the cistern, which
for purposes of cleaning and repairing was that
morning uncovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! my boy! if he should slip!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As he probably will.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that instant Robert stood up to examine
the ancient weather-cock which had attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
him to his perilous perch, and forgetting where
he was began to twist the dingy &#8220;chanticleer&#8221;
upon its rod.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a rush, a cry&mdash;a sudden
downward flash of knickerbockered legs, and
&#8220;Humpty-Dumpty&#8221; had disappeared in the
cistern.</p>

<small>APIS MELLIFICA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;GOOD-MORNING, my dear, good-morning.
I am pleased to see you so punctual.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny looked up brightly. There was surely
nothing stern or forbidding about the fine old
face which smiled genially upon her from the
museum window, and she was instantly ashamed
of her earlier &#8220;dread&#8221; concerning the new task
that day to be begun. &#8220;Good-morning, Mr.
Brook. Of course I would be punctual this
first day. The trouble will be to keep it up.
I&#8217;m a lazy sort of a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I&#8217;ve seen no evidence of it heretofore,
and I shall not watch for faults. How is
the good little mother this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well; really growing stronger, thank you.
I have her own word for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we can get to work with a light heart.
I&#8217;ve laid out a pile of it, I assure you. Like
many other people who defer what they should
not till over-late in life, now I&#8217;ve set myself the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
task I am all impatience to get through it.
Come in, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice knew the way well enough. Till that
morning the great apartment had been a fascinating
wonderland to her, with its rows of
shelves and cases, each filled with creatures curious,
ugly, or beautiful; and the thought that she
was now to learn all about them in a business
way did appear quite formidable. However, she
reminded herself of her mother&#8217;s frequent advice,
&#8220;Take one thing at a time,&#8221; and found comfort
in the knowledge that she could write of only
one insect at one instant. Collectively they
might be something dreadful; individually they
were poor little dried-up affairs!</p>

<p>Then her eye fell upon the table by the opposite
window and her face brightened. &#8220;The
typewriter! When did it come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last evening. The man brought it down
from Newburgh and put it into working order
for you. I am anxious to see you use it. He
did so for a moment, but I did not like to detain
him. It is a wonderful instrument, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. Anyway I am very fond of
using it.&#8221; The girl sat down before the firm
little table which the machine agent had prepared
for her, and, placing a sheet of paper in position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
clicked off Mr. Brook&#8217;s name and address with a
rapidity and correctness which delighted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, my dear! That is fine! If you can
do as well with the rest as with that, you will be
a grand success, you will, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall not be able. We may as well
face that matter first as last. At the beginning
I shall be very stupid. I shall spell every
Latin name wrong, perhaps, and not know the
difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear! Do you think I have not prepared
for that? Why, you must know that the
change of a single letter in some names or descriptions
would result in the utmost confusion;
and in any scientific work perfect orthography is
absolutely necessary. But I have picked up a
few little primers on the subject of our task, and
you are to consult them continually. You will
soon see that there is a general principle in the
construction of all terms, and that spelling Latin
is, after all, easier than spelling English. It is to
me. I frequently have to pause to think out an
English word, oftentimes the simpler the more
puzzling, but a Latin one never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy mortal&mdash;I mean, sir! I fear I shall be
a terrible trial to you. And you must know that
you can send me about my business at the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
blunder, if you feel so inclined. Dear me! That
doesn&#8217;t sound right! What I want to say, only
I am such an old stupid, is: Please do not let your
friendship for us prevent your dismissing me if I
don&#8217;t suit you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! Why, my dear!&#8221; exclaimed Mr.
Brook, very much surprised. &#8220;I thought you
were a girl whose vocabulary did not contain the
word &#8216;fail.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It used to be that way. But now&mdash;I guess
I&#8217;m not as conceited as I was awhile ago. The
older I get the less I feel that I know. And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut! Though that is an excellent state
of things, too. There is hope of a person conscious
of his own deficiencies. But all this in due
time. By the way, have you yet discovered the
secret of the linden-trees, the source of your
wealth that is to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice opened her eyes widely at this abrupt
change of subject, but answered promptly: &#8220;Oh,
no, indeed! I had almost forgotten that! But
what lovely trees they are! They will soon be
in bloom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I suppose, so I suppose. Therefore we
will make our first lesson, or our first day&#8217;s
work, upon the <i>Apis mellifica</i>. You are upon my
mind; after I get your affairs settled more satisfactorily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
I shall be better able to attend to my
own. Yes, yes, that matter first; the other in
due time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny could not conceal her astonishment.
How Mr. Brook&#8217;s talk did wander, from technical
and scientific terms to a fable of hidden
wealth in a row of old trees! She wondered if
her mother had ever observed anything like this,
and if that were what she meant when she so
earnestly counselled patience. Was her beloved
old friend in his second childhood?</p>

<p>He lifted his bright eyes from the page he had
been reading and caught her own questioning
gaze. &#8220;Out with it, my dear, out with it! How
have I surprised you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young secretary hesitated, then answered
frankly, &#8220;I did not see the connection between
my &#8216;treasure&#8217; and your science.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are not a deal more stupid than I
have taken you to be, you will see it within the
next few hours. And you need not fear, I am
all right mentally, my dear; thank God, quite
sound-minded, if I am an octogenarian.&#8221; And
the queer old gentleman crossed the room, laughing
so mischievously that Bonny was forced to
join him, though believing that she was making
mirth at her own expense.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Mr. Brook came back to his own table beside
that of his secretary, bearing an open case of
what she considered very uninteresting &#8220;dried
bugs,&#8221; and placing the case before her pointed
to one and another of the objects therein with
kindling enthusiasm. &#8220;These are different specimens
of the <i>Apis</i>, in perfect forms, in abnormal
ones, in portions, and groups. Every organ
is here represented; this minute affair, for instance.
Ah! you cannot see it as it is, even
with your young eyes. Take the magnifier.
See? Isn&#8217;t it wonderful?&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice took the magnifying-glass and examined
the speck of insect anatomy which her
employer had designated. &#8220;Why, it looks like
a little saw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, exactly. A saw so tiny, yet so
thorough in its work that it can pierce a heavy
buckskin glove if the mechanic who wields it so
desires. Ah! I have been studying these little
fellows for many years, yet I am freshly amazed
each time I see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The enthusiasm was inspiring. Bonny took
up the different cards from the case, and began
to examine them through the microscope. She
had always loved to watch living creatures, but
dead ones had heretofore held little interest for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
her. She found her ideas rapidly changing.
&#8220;Has this queer little saw a name, a common
name, that would mean something to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. It is a sting, a bee&#8217;s sting. <i>Apis
mellifica</i> is honey-bee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is that mite of a thing which
hurts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. A point so small that the finest
cambric needle is larger, yet look! Here are
the two hollows between the saws which, lying
face to face, form a pipe for the poison to flow
through. This is the poison bag. These curious
little affairs are the handles which pump the
sting, the saws, down into the flesh. One
side first, making a wedge-like opening, through
which the other saw is promptly forced. Then
by another motion down goes the fluid which
poisons, or the sac itself is pushed into the wound.
Talk about guns and cannons! Here you have
something far more complete than either, and
in proportion to its size far more dreadful in its
effects. Why, one of these stings has sometimes
killed a man, though I did not mean to refer
to that! Such cases are rare, indeed. And
usually a bee-sting amounts to very little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but you need not reassure me, dear Mr.
Brook! After this exhibition I shall not interfere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
with any bees whose acquaintance I may
chance to make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too positive, my dear, don&#8217;t be too
positive. You may have to change your
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought our work lay among dead
things, all these of your collection. I did not
know that we were to hunt among <i>new</i> fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We</i> are not; but <i>you</i> may, of your own accord,
before I have done with you. I hope so.
Yes, I foresee that you will often leave me in the
midst of a very busy day just because of my
friend <i>Apis</i>, alive and buzzing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again that gay laugh, and again Beatrice&#8217;s
utter mystification.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well. Suppose we read a bit of
natural history this morning; or, rather, I will
dictate to you and you take down what I have
to say. I am writing a little treatise on the
fellow <i>Apis</i>,&mdash;something quite apart from the
collection, as a whole. I mean to publish it for
the benefit of just such bright girls and boys as
you and your brothers. Yes; I&#8217;ll give you a
chapter now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was more business in this arrangement,
and it was business which Bonny had come for;
so she rapidly made ready, and with fingers poised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
above the keys of her machine waited for the
opening sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Foods for the Honey-bee.&#8217; That is the chapter
title, and its number is seven. The other
half-dozen are already prepared, though in my
own handwriting. You will have to copy them
sometime, before publication; but&mdash;ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dictation began. Mr. Brook found it a
little difficult to keep his current of thought as
clear as usual, for the racket of the typewriter
was so foreign to his accustomed quiet; and besides
this the frequent liftings of the typewritist&#8217;s
head, the amused glances of her dark eyes, were so
distracting to the lover of young folks that he
felt more than half inclined to give up the task
for a while and go out upon a search for the new
&#8220;subjects&#8221; they two might find together. However,
he did his best, and at the end of a few
paragraphs Bonny sprang up from her chair in
a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;ve guessed it, I have, I have! I know
what my &#8216;source of wealth&#8217; will be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoity, toity! I thought you were writing
from dictation!&#8221; returned her old patron, smiling
quite as brightly as herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Oh, yes, in a minute. Just,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
please, let me ask you one or two things. May
I? Can I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to prevent a headstrong young
woman like yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe I could manage them all
myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Manage what? Here, Joanna, please!&#8221; called
the pleased old gentleman to his sister crossing
the veranda.</p>

<p>Miss Brook came and leaned upon the window-ledge,
and smiled in upon them. &#8220;Well, I must
say I don&#8217;t know which is the more enthusiastic!
Brother, dear, how old are you? Do you contemplate
going into the business for yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighty, my dear, eighty, if a day! But
look at the child! Hear her ask me, &#8216;Can
she? May she?&#8217; when already she is feeling
herself a millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Let me ask you one or two things. May I?</span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time not a word which an outsider
could have understood had been spoken; and as
this thought flashed over Bonny she laughed
again. &#8220;Dear Mr. Brook, I thought at first that
you were &#8216;not quite yourself&#8217; this morning!
Beg pardon, but I did. And now I am as bad.
Maybe, after all, we are not talking about the
same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not! Oh! I dare say not,&#8221; replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
the merry old gentleman, pacing rapidly back
and forth.</p>



<p>&#8220;And quite difficult for me, I think!&#8221; added
Miss Joanna, smiling too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please tell me <i>your</i> thought, Mr.
Brook?&#8221; asked Beatrice, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure. I would have done so long
ago, only you didn&#8217;t ask it. I think the scheme
I have formulated&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have not heard it in words, Brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The scheme I have formulated, Joanna, will
keep this growing girl out of doors, as she should
be, and make a wise recreation after her hours of
labor here. It will teach her more of real natural
history than I can preach to her, and will
make her far more interested in my work. It
will fill her small pocket with some needed extra
cash. Last, but not least, it will give that unquiet
small brother of hers a chance to get rid of his
surplus energy in a legitimate way. He can do
all the tree-climbing, for which I should, if I
were a girl with such an irrepressible relative,
give him a small share in the business. It&mdash;
Go on, Miss. How can you wish to interrupt
such a flow of argument?&#8221;</p>

<p>As if he had been the grandfather he had himself
suggested, Bonny crossed swiftly to her employer&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
side and laid her hand upon his shoulder.
&#8220;Because I thank you for showing me how to
help myself. The one word which will tell <i>my</i>
thought is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Dolloway&#8217;s solemn face
appeared above Miss Joanna&#8217;s own with such
suddenness that Bonny&#8217;s &#8220;word&#8221; waited for his.
He had evidently come freighted with ill news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sir, what is it? Is my mother&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolloway shook his head dolefully, but a
genuine distress was in the gesture. &#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t
your mother, Miss Beatrice. It&#8217;s that pesky,
dear little brother of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened him? Anything new?
The hens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hens! If it was only hens! But hens it
isn&#8217;t this time. It&#8217;s roofs an&#8217; cisterns an&#8217; bangs
an&#8217; black-an&#8217;-blues. If he ain&#8217;t dead&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Bonny did not pause to remember that
she was a salaried employee, but, without leave
or license, darted from the house and across the
fields with an aching heart.</p>

<small>STREAKS OF HUMAN NATURE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;IT must be something dreadful this time!
Roland has left his ploughing, and the old
horse is walking about as she pleases. The men
are not working upon the cistern, and&mdash; Can
it be he is drowned?&#8221;</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed through the sister&#8217;s
mind as she hurried homeward, past the field of
sweet-smelling, freshly turned sods where her
brother&#8217;s plough stood idly in the furrow; and as
she burst into the sitting-room her face was white
and her breath well spent.</p>

<p>But nothing so very dreadful met her gaze.
Robert was, indeed, lying upon the lounge well
wrapped in blankets, but his dark eyes were the
first to discover Bonny&#8217;s entrance, and his voice
the one to demand: &#8220;What you home for, Bon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;you precious darling! Aren&#8217;t
you killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull&mdash;wull&mdash;I guess not! What&#8217;s the
matter with you, anyway? What&#8217;s the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
with everybody? Can&#8217;t a feller slide offen a roof
&#8217;ithout stirrin&#8217; up the hull neighborhood, I&#8217;d
like to know!&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle had been sitting, watching the patient,
but at this outburst of remonstrance she laughed
and left her post. &#8220;I&#8217;ll find Mother now, and
tell her you&#8217;ve come in. I think Bob is all right,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course I am. Who said I wasn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your &#8216;chum,&#8217; Mr. Dolloway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! What&#8217;d he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember exactly. Oh, yes, I do,
too. He said &#8216;roofs,&#8217; &#8216;cisterns,&#8217; &#8216;bangs,&#8217; &#8216;blacks
and blues,&#8217; etc. What did he mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;. Only I slid offen the roof into the
cistern. Nen he an&#8217; my mother come an&#8217; made
a dretful time. They said I was &#8217;bout killed, but
I wasn&#8217;t. An&#8217; my mother she sent Roland off
fer a doctor-man, &#8217;cause she&#8217;s boun&#8217; I&#8217;ve broke
some o&#8217; my insides. She says a feller couldn&#8217;t
jest slide that little bit &#8217;ithout hurtin&#8217; hisself
somehow. It wasn&#8217;t no use I tellin&#8217; her. Roland
went quick as lightnin&#8217;. Nen the carpenter an&#8217;
mortar man they went away to get some more
stuff to fix the thing up so&#8217;s I can&#8217;t slide in no
more; an&#8217; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All! Robert, you certainly will scare my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
mother to death with your behavior, even if you
don&#8217;t get killed yourself. And if you&#8217;re not
hurt, why are you lying here wrapped up this
fashion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause my mother made me. What&#8217;s more,
she took my clothes away, an&#8217; says they&#8217;ve got
to be washed an&#8217; I&#8217;ll have ter lie still till they
dry. I think it&#8217;s mean I can&#8217;t wear my Sunday
ones; don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is a wise precaution. But how in
the world did you manage to slide off the roof?
What were you doing up there? Tell me the
whole story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted ter make the rooster turn round
faster. He&#8217;s rusty on his hinges, Mr. Dolloway
says, &#8217;cause he, the rooster, is awful old, old
as Mr. Brook maybe. An&#8217; I got my mother&#8217;s
oil-can, &#8217;cause he said old things needs oilin&#8217;,
an&#8217; I clumb up. I was goin&#8217; to s&#8217;prise you all,
an&#8217;&mdash; It&#8217;s mean. I can climb like anything
now, Bon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you fall? On your head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! What fools girls is! If I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; fell on
my head, I would &#8217;a&#8217; been hurt, you bet. But I
just slid inter that pile o&#8217; mortar the men had
mixed ter fix the cistern with. My feet went in
clear up to my waist! Nen, when my mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
caught hold o&#8217; me, she had a nawful job to pull
me out. She got all over dirt herself, too; so
she&#8217;s got to have her clothes washed too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the bruises? Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert struggled to unwind himself from the
folds of blanket in which maternal anxiety had
enswathed his plump little limbs and displayed
those members with a look of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shades of Jacob&#8217;s coat&mdash;Joseph&#8217;s, I mean!
There is not an inch of originally colored skin
upon you! But see here, young man! Those
are not all <i>new</i> bruises; though, if Mr. Dolloway
saw them, I don&#8217;t wonder he thought you were
about killed. Those are the scars of many battles
with misfortune, if I&#8217;m not much mistaken!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, who said they wasn&#8217;t? That yeller
an&#8217; green patch, that come the time I fell
out the cherry-tree, the first day I got here.
That&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the enumeration. You are beautifully
mottled, sort of like a tortoise-shell cat.
And I&#8217;ve run away from my work, scared poor
Miss Joanna into a fit, and behaved altogether
badly, just because you slid off a roof! Now I
must take my bit of lunch quickly and get back.
And, by the way, Bob, if you&#8217;ll promise not to
do anything more to plague Motherkin all this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
day till I get home again, I&#8217;ll tell you a secret,
a good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child&#8217;s face lighted eagerly, and a rash
promise was on his tongue&#8217;s end, but he bethought
himself of the chrysanthemum affair
and paused in time. &#8220;Pooh! I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s som&#8217;thin&#8217;
to get me inter another scrape. Nen&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so wise, my dear. I am going to
tell my mother the first. But I thought it would
please you to know, too, and you could be making
happy plans while you were obliged to lie
here. Heigho! There comes Roland and somebody
in a phaeton! The doctor, I suppose. Now,
my sweet, you&#8217;re in for it! I hope it will be a
lesson to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bon, don&#8217;t go away! You wouldn&#8217;t leave
a feller in a trouble, would you? An&#8217; if he
should, mebbe he will, find I was smashed
up inside somewhere, how bad you&#8217;d feel about
fersakin&#8217; your poor little brother, wouldn&#8217;t you?
I&mdash;I wish you&#8217;d stay, Bon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must let the professional gentleman in first,
then find my mother. But if you behave like a
little soldier he won&#8217;t hurt you very much, not
so <i>very</i> much!&#8221;</p>

<p>Beatrice felt a little guilty in frightening
the unlucky child as she was doing; still she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
believed that it might result in future relief to
the rest of the family, and persisted. Robert
had never been placed under a physician&#8217;s
care before; for the innumerable bumps and
bruises he had suffered at the mischance of fate
or his own mischief had been cared for by maternal
hands alone. Ditto all the childish diseases
with which he, in common with the rest of the
juvenile world, had been afflicted; and it was,
perhaps, one of the reasons for the young Beckwiths&#8217;
good health that their mother had been too
poor to dose them with drugs, but had relied as
far as might be on Doctor Nature instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;She must have been terribly frightened this
time, to have sent for a physician!&#8221; thought
Beatrice, as she admitted the gentleman; and it
was not until she had questioned Isabelle that
she learned how serious the boy&#8217;s hurt had at
first been supposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He lay unconscious for more than an hour,
Bonny; and I never saw Mother so distressed.
She thought he had been injured internally, and
could not rest until she had somebody examine
him. Poor little chap! he&#8217;ll be felt of from
head to foot now; and I, too, hope it will be
a lesson to him. I actually fear he will be
killed sometime in some of these &#8216;accidents.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;Not a bit of it! At least I don&#8217;t think so
now, though Mr. Dolloway did frighten me.
But what a pretty little luncheon you have
set out! Did you make that batch of biscuits,
or Motherkin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I myself. And, Bonny, I&#8217;m sorry I was
so hateful about the housework. Mother has
been talking with me and showing me how I can
manage. She thinks after I have learned I may
be almost as quick as you; and if I plan my
work systematically from day to day, that I will
be able to get some hours each day for painting
or sketching. If I do not have to give up all I
dreamed, I shall not mind it so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny threw her arms about her sister&#8217;s neck,
and gave her a loving kiss. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s
splendid of you, Belle! I have wished I could do
both your share and that for which Mr. Brook
has offered me payment. But I cannot; and
something I read the other night may be a help
to all of us. It was about &#8216;traditions,&#8217; binding
ourselves to do just as everybody has settled is
the best way for the majority to do. I am not a
lucid explainer, but it is like this: I&#8217;ve heard
you quote dear Miss Joanna for authority in
housekeeping matters, country housekeeping; and
her servants say she is a &#8216;model.&#8217; Certainly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
great mansion is always spick and span from top
to bottom; but that is for <i>her</i>, not for <i>us</i>.
There are so many things we can let go, or
rather, never undertake, that are wholly unnecessary.
The article said that, given a perfect
cleanliness, many other ideas about &#8216;dirt&#8217; were
just &#8216;fussiness.&#8217; In the first place, she who
wishes to do something else with her time besides
housekeeping should never burden her rooms
with knick-knacks. &#8216;Trash,&#8217; that writer called
the lots of things one generally strews about on
tables and shelves. Every extra article put into
a room means so much extra dusting and cleaning,
and so much time to do that in. And a
lot more talk like that. It seemed to me, when
I had finished reading, that housework might be
made ever so much simpler and shorter if one
studied how in the same way one studies to learn
anything else. For instance, when I began my
typewriting it seemed to me that I should never
be able to write fast enough to earn my salt; but
after a while it came easier, till, for a girl of my
age, I really think I do quite well both at
that and lecturing! Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you have certainly talked faster than
you have eaten; but the notion is a good one.
It is ever so much like what Mother told me this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
morning. Must you go? Won&#8217;t you wait to
see her first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought not. She is closeted with the doctor,
and bent upon finding broken bones somewhere
about Bob&#8217;s anatomy. With that end in
view she will be unseeable for some time to come.
And look! Roland is chasing that nag, the first
time I ever saw her gallop in her life! Poor
boy! Give him my kindest regards, accept the
same for yourself, and believe me, yours truly,
Bon! Really, Belle, I think you&#8217;re splendid, and
your lunch was fine; and Roland is a pattern,&mdash;my
mother says so,&mdash;and Robert is the dearest,
roughest, most exciting little chap in the world.
We are a brilliant family! And I have another
fine scheme which I will divulge to the assembled
multitude this evening. No; it&#8217;s not my scheme,
either, it&#8217;s Mr. Brook&#8217;s; so, sure to be right.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell! But, say, Bonny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; turning upon the doorstep, with a
bit of impatience showing on her merry face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you talk all the time when you are at
Mr. Brook&#8217;s, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isabelle!&#8221; called Mrs. Beckwith&#8217;s voice from
the sitting-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>&#8220;Please make a cup of tea and bring it to the
doctor, with a plate of biscuit. He has a long
drive before him, and must not be let to go
without something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear me! My mother&#8217;s hospitality is
something formidable! The very first biscuits I
ever made! And this tea doesn&#8217;t taste like that
we used to get in town! But if she had only a
glass of cold water and a bit of hard-tack, she&#8217;d
offer it to the Queen of England, with just that
same easy grace. Well, one thing I foresee in
the country is the frequency of &#8216;droppers in,&#8217; as
Mr. Dolloway calls them. But the next caller who
comes shall have better biscuits than these, even
if Bonny did praise them. And after all, it&#8217;s
rather pleasant to think people are willing to be
social with you, as country folks seem inclined,
without knowing all about your past life. That&#8217;s
one thing I like! And there&#8217;s something very
pleasant in the word &#8216;neighbor.&#8217; I love to hear
Miss Joanna say it, in her low voice; and if I
am to be a house-mistress I&#8217;m going to be a good
&#8216;neighbor,&#8217; too, with her for a pattern as well
as my little Motherkin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether the reflections with which Isabelle
prepared her tray of simple refreshments had
anything to do with the grace of the serving may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
be guessed; certainly, instead of the half-frown
which Mrs. Beckwith feared to see, the girl&#8217;s
manner was so genial and withal so modest that
the plain fare acquired a keen relish for the
hungry physician, who had still many miles to
drive before he could find leisure for his own
table; and he went away with the thought in
mind: &#8220;That family is an addition to the town.
I like them. I like them all, from the fragile-looking
mother down to the rough little boy.
But he&#8217;s a shaver! I took good care to punch
hardest on the sorest places, for he needs a lesson!
Well, that may be my first visit, but I
think it will not be my last to The Lindens,
under the new r&eacute;gime!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, I am pleased with you!&#8221; said Mrs.
Beckwith, warmly, giving her daughter a motherly
caress. &#8220;I was afraid you would find it a trial
to be hospitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, Motherkin! But I&mdash;conquered.&#8221;</p>

<p>A second kiss followed the first, and Isabelle
resolved that the next tax put upon her &#8220;neighborliness&#8221;
should not be matter of so much
surprise to her little mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Bob all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, fortunately, though he is badly scared.
And he is the strangest child. He will never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
climb upon that slippery roof again, but he
is as certain to do something quite as bad and
not to be anticipated, the moment he has his liberty.
I wish there was a good school near; but
that is the drawback to this place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny used to be almost as ingenious for
mischief, didn&#8217;t she? I remember when some
&#8216;flats&#8217; were building on the block next our home
you forbade her &#8216;ever playing on that pile of
lumber again.&#8217; She never did, but she played on
another pile which you hadn&#8217;t mentioned and
broke her arm. Still, she is a pretty good sort
of a girl now, and very clever, everybody says.
She was the youngest, you know, in our typewriting
class, and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if she were
the very first to get a situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I have faith, perfect faith, in
all my dear ones, Isabelle. But now, if there
are any more of those biscuits left, please call
Roland in and we will have our lunch. This has
been one of the days when housekeeping could
not go by rule and measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope there won&#8217;t be many such!&#8221; exclaimed
the daughter, earnestly, and went to summon her
elder brother. But she presently returned with
a disappointed face. &#8220;He says he cannot come,
that he does not care for anything to eat. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
has lost so much time already, and he had set
out to accomplish just so much of that ploughing
this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s hesitation; then Mrs.
Beckwith herself went to the door and called
pleasantly: &#8220;Roland! lunch is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not coming, Mother; I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must. I cannot allow you to go without
eating regularly, now that you are doing hard
labor for the first time in your life. Please
come at once, and do not hinder Isabelle any
longer. She, too, has had a disappointing morning
in some ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Roland was but seventeen. If he had been
ten years older, he would not have answered as he
did. &#8220;Oh, Mother, I wish you&#8217;d let me alone!
I&#8217;m not a baby to be ordered like Robert! And
I am not&mdash;going&mdash;to eat&mdash;one mouthful till I&mdash;am
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isabelle could scarce believe that she heard the
words, which were only too distinct through the
open doorway. &#8220;Humph! That&#8217;s what comes
of making a stripling the &#8216;head of the family.&#8217;
That sounds like one of those young roosters of
Miss Joanna&#8217;s trying to crow. That&#8217;s what
comes of sacrificing &#8216;womenkind to our young
man.&#8217; The horrid thing!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>&#8220;Isabelle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Startled by the sharpness of pain which the tone
evinced, Belle looked swiftly into her mother&#8217;s
eyes, and read there that the matter was not a
theme for jest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little woman!&#8221; thought the girl, as she
cleared away the lunch things; &#8220;how it does hurt
her when she discovers that we <i>are</i> coarse barnyard
fowls, after all! Poor little woman! She&#8217;d
die for any of us, if it were necessary, but we
just make her heart ache with &#8216;cussedness&#8217;!
H&#8217;m-m! I begin to think the Beckwiths are not
that brilliant collection of perfections Bonny
claimed! Bob spoiled the morning, and now
Roland has finished the afternoon! Though I
must admit <i>I</i> began the list of sorrows by behaving
like a selfish, silly thing, crying over the
dishes!&#8221;</p>

<p>For somehow upon the bright spring landscape
a shadow seemed to have fallen; and though Roland
carried his point and finished the number of
furrows he desired, the sods he turned no longer
greeted his nostrils with that sweet odor which
had given him such pleasure heretofore, and
between himself and the ground appeared all
through that afternoon the gentle reproachful
face of a mother aggrieved.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BONNY brought her song to an end beside her
brother at the door of the little stable,
whither, at the close of the afternoon, he had
guided his horse; and though her rich young voice
was music in his ears, Roland turned toward his
sister a face which did not respond to the mirth
of hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Bon! Back? Well, how does it seem
to be a day-laborer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! my laddie, how does it seem to be a
ploughman? Prettier in song than reality, eh?
Why, Roland!&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;Well, what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you there isn&#8217;t anything the matter
with&mdash;me. I&#8217;m not accountable for other people&#8217;s
whims.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad dropped the head-stall, and Nan, set
free of her harness, walked quietly into her own
place; while Beatrice, perching herself upon the
manger&#8217;s front, threw her arms about her brother&#8217;s
neck and gave him a resounding smack.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! That&#8217;s for &#8216;my ploughman, my jo&#8217;!
Say, my dear, you have the heart-ache!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother, Bon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather bother Roland! What is it, Laureate?
You will have to tell me sometime, you
know; you might as well now. Besides, I&#8217;m
dying to tell you something in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tell. Then, maybe&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A swarm of bees in May is worth a load of
hay!&#8217; How did you guess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess what? I wish you wouldn&#8217;t be silly,
Bon. My head aches, I&#8217;m awfully tired, and
I&#8217;m crosser than cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That last is an axiom,&mdash;a self-evident fact,
you know; and I&#8217;m sorry for the head, but sorrier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
for the heart. Something has gone wrong,
ever so far wrong. What is it, Bubsey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice, if you don&#8217;t stop using that ridiculous
name for me, I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss me, Roland, and make up. I declare
it makes me feel as down-spirited as Mr. Dolloway
in a rheumatic attack to come home all full
of my scheme and have you throw cold water on
me this way. Really, dear, you must tell me.
You know I always tease till I find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roland looked at her angrily; but there was
something so genuinely loving and sympathetic
in the piquant face before him that he felt moved
to unburden his mind of the load it had carried.
Not a very big load, some lads might think, but,
to a nature as earnest and chivalrous as Roland
Beckwith&#8217;s, quite bitter enough. &#8220;Well, then,
I have behaved outrageously to my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roland&mdash;Beckwith! You!&#8221;</p>

<p>In two minutes the little story had been told.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Motherkin say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one word. If she&#8217;d only scold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s one disobliging thing about our
mother. I &#8216;sym,&#8217; dear; I&#8217;ve been there myself.
I&#8217;ve often felt as if a good, downright nagging
wouldn&#8217;t hurt one-thousandth part as much as
one of those astonished glances of hers. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
cut like a knife just home from the sharpener&#8217;s.
Well, so you didn&#8217;t have any luncheon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want any; I couldn&#8217;t have eaten
it, after that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That accounts for the headache; so both
head and heart pains are settled for. Now, the
cure. Come along with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;d rather not. If Mother happened
out here, I&#8217;d talk it over with her. I&#8217;m a confounded
idiot, Bon. I felt so big and manly,
somehow, thinking I had the whole &#8216;farm&#8217; under
my own control; and then I was mad at that
young one everlastingly getting into trouble for
somebody else to be plagued with; and I&#8217;d made
up my mind to accomplish just so much of the
ploughing, no matter what happened. And it <i>is</i>
awful hard work. I wouldn&#8217;t acknowledge it
before; but it seems sometimes as if I couldn&#8217;t
drag one foot after the other. And look at my
hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>The flood-gates of his pride and reserve opened
at last, all the trials and actual sufferings the
untaught lad had experienced during his brief
experiment of farming tumbled over Roland&#8217;s
lips in a torrent of words. He felt perfectly
secure in making these confidences, for whatever
her faults might be, Beatrice &#8220;never blabbed,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
and she loved him so dearly that all he felt was
shared by her in almost a stronger degree. When
he had finished there were tears in her bright
eyes; and she forced Roland to take a portion
of the sharp-edged seat she occupied, so that she
might &#8220;cuddle to him&#8221; with her warm sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is, Laureate! Brother
Dolloway is right! &#8216;Life isn&#8217;t all catnip!
They&#8217;s consid&#8217;able burdock an&#8217; puss&#8217;ley mixed
through it.&#8217; But we&#8217;ve got to get along with
it the best we can; and all the matter with us is
we&#8217;re too &#8216;all-fired&#8217; smart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bon! don&#8217;t laugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t I shall cry; and I&#8217;m only copying
my respected mother when I say I&#8217;d &#8216;ruther
laugh.&#8217; But I mean it. We&#8217;re smart. We&#8217;re
dangerously clever, and we know it; that&#8217;s all
the trouble. You are a seventeen-year-older and
you&#8217;ve been attempting to do and to be a
grown-up man,&mdash;I mean, to do what a man long
trained to hard work would do; and that has
made you feel as if you were a man in every
respect. If you can just get back to be Roland
the lad, you&#8217;ll be all right. And I&#8217;m not a-preachin&#8217;
no sermons what I isn&#8217;t willin&#8217; ter take
home to myself. No, sir. I&#8217;ve been that conceited
an&#8217; &#8216;sot up&#8217; that I actually felt as if there could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
nobody take my place at home; yet at the same
time there was nobody could take my place abroad,
so to speak, and abroad being Mr. Brook&#8217;s study.
But I&#8217;ve been a dunce. All I have to do for Mr.
Brook anybody with a reasonable amount of intelligence&mdash;not
so much as mine, of course!
but an ordinary capacity, like anybody&#8217;s not a
Beckwith&mdash;could do. I made heaps of blunders
when we really set to work this afternoon, and
my blessed old gentleman came mighty near losing
his temper. He didn&#8217;t quite lose it, however,
though he danced around on the edge of the
precipice for a few minutes, and it would have
gone over, I think, if Miss Joanna hadn&#8217;t appeared.
It all came from my self-conceit, every
bit of it. I read a few rules for the orthography
and then I thought I knew it all; and off I
dashed, hot foot, and had three whole pages
to rewrite, besides the annoyance to my employer
of the wasted time. But <i>that</i> won&#8217;t happen
again. I&#8217;ve put on the brakes and I mean to go
slow next time, probably too slow; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Roland knew that the only way to stem the
current of Beatrice&#8217;s talk was to interrupt, which
he did without ceremony. &#8220;Do you suppose my
mother would come out here to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she would walk on her head if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
asked her; but I shouldn&#8217;t think it a manly
thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? I hate to make a talk before
Belle and&mdash;everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roland, don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m hateful, but you
didn&#8217;t hesitate to speak horridly to Mother before
&#8216;everybody,&#8217; did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was mad then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re sad now. No, a King Arthur
kind of a fellow would go just as manfully to
make his apologies as he did to commit his error.
It will make Mother happy to hear your regret,
no matter how you express it; but it will make
her proud as well if you do so openly. Besides,
what a shining example you will be to Bob-o&#8217;-Lincoln!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear little chap! I thought he was a goner,
this morning. I tell you he looked awful when
we got him out of that mortar heap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think he must! But if Nan has
enough to eat, let&#8217;s go into the peace-room and
have a happy time. I do wonder, every time
I&#8217;m bad, why I can&#8217;t remember then how horrid
it feels to be unhappy. I never do, and good
resolutions aren&#8217;t worth very much above par
in my case.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Roland did not answer, but went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
about putting his little stable into order for the
night, and finding in the sense of proprietorship
this gave him a slight solace for his wounded
pride. For it was that, rather than actual repentance,
which had tortured him all that afternoon.
His nature, prone to idealize everything,
had set up a standard of perfect gentlemanliness
to be achieved, and the thought that he had been
so petty as to lose temper with a woman, and that
woman his mother, whom he was most bound to
protect, had mortified him intolerably. It may
not have been the highest sort of standard, but it
was ennobling as far as it went.</p>

<p>When he could find no further excuse for
loitering, he went to the pump and begged his
sister to dash a stream of cold water over his
aching temples; then rising, shook himself like a
young water dog, and strode valiantly out of the
building.</p>

<p>Bonny did not glance at him again, but taking
up her Scottish melody went carolling into the
house as if to herald a coming joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, darling! Home again! After a long
day of work. It is sweet of you to come so
gayly, for you must be very tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is perfectly lovely of you, Motherkin,
to take each little bit of decency in your offspring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
and magnify it into a virtue. But you&#8217;ll have
your reward, my Madonna! You&#8217;re going to have
part of it&mdash;instantly!&#8221; cried the girl, nodding
her head sagely, and crossing immediately to
Robert&#8217;s lounge, where she dropped down and fell
to caressing that imprisoned piece of activity.</p>

<p>Roland did nothing by halves. He walked
directly toward his mother, and said in a clear
voice, so that the dreaded &#8220;everybody&#8221; might
hear: &#8220;Mother, I beg your pardon. I behaved
like a ruffian.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ready tears sprung to the mother&#8217;s eyes as
her tall son bent to kiss her, but she answered as
she would have answered any other who had
trespassed upon good manners: &#8220;Don&#8217;t mention
it, dear. And I&#8217;m glad you are both in together,
for Isabelle and I have been experimenting in
the kitchen, and by the odor from thence I think
our chicken-patties are done and ripe for eating!&#8221;
Then she rose, took the arm of her &#8220;knight,&#8221;
and led the way to the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, wull, ain&#8217;t I a-goin&#8217; ter have nothin&#8217;?&#8221;
demanded the &#8220;invalid,&#8221; indignantly, as
Bonny rose also, and he was threatened with
apparent neglect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s about time for Sunday
clothes?&#8221; asked that young person, coaxingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>&#8220;Ye-s; if Robert will be&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be as good as a gold boy, Motherkin!
I&#8217;ll be as good as Roland, if I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>A general laugh greeted this promise, and under
cover of it, Bonny lifted her little brother
from his couch of punishment and bore him aloft,
to return in about five minutes looking perfectly
cherubic in a clean face and the aforementioned
holiday attire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Bonny, after the supper things
had been cleared away and the little household
had gathered before the blaze upon the hearth,
which partly Mrs. Beckwith&#8217;s fondness for it and
partly the still chilly evenings rendered a nightly
affair,&mdash;&#8220;now have I at last the permission of
the household to relieve my mind of its terrible
tension? I have been keeping a secret for&mdash;six&mdash;mortal&mdash;hours
and if I can&#8217;t tell it soon I
shall be ill, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Secretary has the floor!&#8221; responded the
now joyful mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, it has been proposed to me&mdash; No, that
isn&#8217;t the best, the most mysterious way of beginning.
Ahem! Has anybody found out the hidden
source of my promised wealth? Has anybody
learned the secret of The Lindens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; answered Robert, promptly, &#8220;skunks.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;Oh, you horrid youngster! Say &#8216;Mephitis&#8217;
whenever you have occasion to mention so inodorous
a subject. No, you are not right. Next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knowledge under difficulties,&#8221; volunteered
Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re away off&mdash;a thousand miles, though
it <i>will</i> be knowledge under difficulties&mdash;exceedingly
painful ones, too, probably. I&#8217;ll explain
that ambiguity later. Now, next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Contentment, which is better than any
riches,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Beckwith, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Motherkin. Sorry to send you &#8216;down
foot,&#8217; but obliged to do it, you know. Roland?
Have you no ideas to be ventilated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are quite like Mother&#8217;s. Health, independence,
and happiness will come to us here
under a lot of hard toil. And, yes, my &#8216;express
wagon.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? What is that? Have you a secret
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too gallant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were &#8216;dying to explain&#8217; a moment
since!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. My secret is&mdash;a bee, <i>Apis mellifica</i>,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
most lively little fellow with a saw in
his latter end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon. But I&#8217;m so excited! Mr.
&#8216;Humpty-Dumpty&#8217; and I are almost immediately
to become apiarists!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Child, what has put such a notion as that into
your head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our beloved Mr. Brook, and Miss Joanna
also. They saw a chance for us to make some
money, which we all agree we need, and suggested
that method. They have explained the whole
transaction to me, as well as anybody can explain
by just talking, and to-morrow, if you approve,
we are to drive a few miles into the country and
visit a famous apiary of which Mr. Brook knows.
There I can see the practical working of the thing,
and I am assured that we can find a market for
our honey&mdash;when we get it! What do you say,
Motherkin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I say, dearie, with so little knowledge
of the subject as I possess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if Miss Brook and Mr. Brook and even
Mr. Dolloway approve, you&#8217;ll say yes, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will always say yes to reasonable things. I
foresee that I shall yet do so to this new scheme.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
But what is the connection between bees and
lindens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same that there was between your hungry
girl and Isabelle&#8217;s chicken-patties. The trees
furnish the bees a favorite food in great abundance.
Then, to supplement them, Roland will plant some
crops which will be useful to Mr. Apis or Mrs.
Apis, and that will also be good for us. The
honey they take away will not hurt any crop he
can raise. Robert is to be the one to help swarm
the bees and to look after them while I am away.
He is to share in the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he makes it such a success as the hen affair,
I am sure we shall be millionaires eventually!&#8221;
laughed the elder sister, teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the youngster time, Madam Housekeeper!
His hens are going to come out all right; aren&#8217;t
they, &#8216;Humpty-Dump&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. Belle doesn&#8217;t know, does she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle never kept any hens, did she? and
Robert did!&#8221; returned Bonny, gayly. Whatever
the others might think, she never lost faith in
either brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;But will it not cost a great deal to begin the
business, much more than we ought to spare at
present?&#8221; asked Mrs. Beckwith.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think not. Mr. Brook suggests that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
use my own earnings for the purpose, if you will
allow me. He is confident I shall get back more
than a fair interest upon the investment. You
see, he isn&#8217;t telling anything he has not already
verified. He&#8217;s a wonderful man, is Mr Brook!&#8221;
responded Beatrice, falling into a reverie, which
lasted so long that Roland interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all acknowledged that long since.
What now has roused your admiration?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, everything he thinks will be a help to
somebody he experiments with himself first. It
was so with bee-keeping. There was a crippled
man with a delicate wife and lots of children, in
whom our patron was interested. The man was
hurt in a railway accident, or something like
that, and could never afterward do any hard work.
Mr. Brook&#8217;s study of bees and their habits made
him think that an apiary would be just the thing
for this family, who had a bit of a place a few
miles from here, the same place he wishes me to
visit to-morrow. So he tried the thing himself,
and demonstrated that it was a paying thing;
then he handed his bee outfit over to those people,
and they are now living very comfortably,
besides being able to educate their children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just from bees?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just from bees. And it is not a business so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
overstocked that others need fear to enter it. If
Mother is willing, I shall be so glad to try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will need a great deal of patience, and
you will get terribly stung.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything needs patience, seems to me!
The very quality of which I have the smallest
stock is continually in demand. And as for the
stinging, some people scarcely feel the stings,
others have been killed by them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice! you are not using a good argument
in favor of your scheme,&#8221; remonstrated the
careful mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, wull, if I&#8217;m goin&#8217; ter be stung ter
death, I&#8217;d ruther stick to hens,&#8221; remarked Robert,
sagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was only to put the very worst foot forward,
my dearie. The persons stung to death
may have been one out of a million. Besides,
you have already been stung a dozen times since
we came here, by one bug or other, and you are
still very much alive, as witness your escapade of
this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, can I have a drink of milk?&#8221;
asked &#8220;Humpty-Dumpty,&#8221; desiring to change the
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Beatrice will get it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll do anything for my partner!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
replied the girl, gayly. &#8220;But, just by way of getting
down to facts, how many drinks of milk
have you already had since you left your bed this
day&mdash;this morning, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good for him, dear,&#8221; commented Mrs.
Beckwith, pleasantly; &#8220;and such a luxury that
we have a cow, and milk of our own to drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny danced out of the room, and down the
stairs cellarward, either not hearing or not obeying
her mother&#8217;s suggestion that she would better
take a candle with her. The others, left before
the cheerful firelight, sat idly musing over the
bee project or some other hopeful plan, even the
milk-hungry boy was silent, when there came
the sound of a heavy fall, the crashing of china,
and the shrill shriek of Beatrice, in a mingled
confusion that sent every person to a standing
posture and chilled every heart with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s fallen downstairs! She must have
broken her bones!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My custard! my custard!&#8221; cried Belle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />


<small>ROLAND&#8217;S PROJECT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;BONNY, are you hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny, have you spilled my custards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonny, have you broken down the stairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer to all these anxious inquiries, which
indicated the particular dread of each inquirer,
there presently came up from the region of darkness
below a ripple of hysterical laughter, which
rapidly increased in volume till the hearers were
forced to join in it.</p>

<p>This was more than Robert could patiently endure,
and, regardless of Sunday clothes, he bounded
down the stairs, and so noisily that he did not
hear Beatrice&#8217;s swift remonstrance: &#8220;Don&#8217;t, Bob!
For mercy&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t come down here! There,
you&#8217;ve finished it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith quietly and cautiously followed
the headlong flight of her youngest child, and
half-way to the lower floor stopped in utter dismay.
There, at the bottom of the flight, sat
Bonny, with Robert in her lap, whither he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
fallen promptly, amidst a pile of broken cups, and
with each of the unfortunates plentifully splashed
with some sort of sticky, yellowish liquid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have you done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, spilled the custards!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing with them?&#8221; demanded
Isabelle, sharply, from the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;that is, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t go for to do
nothing&#8217; with them! When I went away to work
yesterday morning, there were two pans of milk on
that swing-shelf. I could have gone in the dark
and found them easily; so I did!&#8221; And away
went Beatrice into another peal of laughter as
infectious as it was ridiculous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother told you to take a light!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear her. Besides, it didn&#8217;t seem
worth while to go to that trouble. Why did you
put custards in the milk&#8217;s place? And also, if
you have custards, why don&#8217;t you feed them to
your family instead of laying pitfalls with them
to catch unwary maidens? When I was housekeeper
I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you were housekeeper you did exactly
as you pleased, and nobody durst interfere!&#8221; said
Belle, quickly. &#8220;You see, Mother! It&#8217;s of no
use trying. There I worked extra hard to-night,
so that I would not have to take my precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
morning light to-morrow to prepare dessert. I
knew that our dinner was to be a very plain one,
and so I thought I would piece it out with a little
second course. All for nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith made no comment upon this exclamation.
The damage which Bonny&#8217;s thoughtlessness
had done was, she feared, far greater
than the loss of a little daylight or one day&#8217;s
dessert. &#8220;Gather up your frock as carefully as
you can, so that the stuff will not drip upon
these clean stairs, then go directly out of doors;
that is, if you are not hurt. I will come out on
the grass and help you there. Here, Robert!
Put this apron about you and follow Bonny.
Your unfortunate Sunday clothes! They are
ruined, I am afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isabelle retreated in a flood of tears, and
Roland ran away to compose a sonnet to a
&#8220;Maiden in Distress;&#8221; that being a safety-valve
to let off his mirthfulness over the absurd affair.
But Beatrice picked herself up stiffly and obeyed
her mother without a word. Her fun had quite
evaporated, and she felt heartily ashamed of
herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that eternal, undying conceit of mine,
Motherkin! If I&#8217;d had any sense I&#8217;d have
taken a lamp, even though I did not hear you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
But no! I&mdash;Bonny Beckwith&mdash;could go down
cellar in the darkest night and do anything I
wished! I wasn&#8217;t afraid,&mdash;I! But I&#8217;m so sorry,
so awfully sorry about your pretty cups, Mother.
You have had them so long and kept them
so carefully. I don&#8217;t understand yet how it
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The explanation is simple enough. After
Isabelle had made her custard, she poured it into
the cups, and, it being hot, set them in an empty
pan to carry the better downstairs. She had
used the milk from the pan on the swing-shelf,
and it was a convenient place to keep her dessert
until to-morrow, safe and high above the reach
of the cat or any stray mice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was high enough, in all conscience! I
had to reach above my head to take the pan
down, and I thought it felt amazing heavy then;
but not until I reached the foot of the stairs and
stumbled did I hear the cups rattle and realize
that it wasn&#8217;t just milk I carried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, turn around. The other side is all
messed with it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it spoiled, Mother? Is my new clothes no
more good?&#8221; wailed Robert, ruefully regarding
the liberal dash of water which his mother gave
those cherished articles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;They will never look well again, but they
will be wearable, I hope. Bonny&#8217;s fresh frock is
unfit for further use, however, until after it is
laundered again. What will you wear to-morrow,
child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old winter one, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you are going away with your employer,
will it answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best one, then. When a body has just
one good gown and two week-day ones, she hasn&#8217;t
much trouble in making her decisions. I care
only about the cups.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think of them again. I am thankful
you were not hurt. But, my darling, is there
nothing else you are sorry for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&mdash;suppose&mdash;so! The quarrel with
Belle. But she was as much to blame as I. She
shouldn&#8217;t have put the pan there if she didn&#8217;t
want it tipped over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Broken cups may be replaced, and soiled
frocks made clean. These are trivialities; but a
wounded spirit&mdash;I believe I can trust my Beatrice,
can I not? Now come indoors. Roland
has, also, a &#8216;secret&#8217; to tell, or a statement to
explain. He is probably impatient to do so.
About the express wagon. Come, Robert. It is
almost your bedtime, anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;Mother, if anybody isn&#8217;t good who lives with
you, she ought to be &#8216;kicked by cripples&#8217;! You&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beatrice, where do you learn such expressions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That came from Brother&mdash;I mean Mr.&mdash;Dolloway&#8217;s
vocabulary. He has a choice lot of
&#8216;Sayings&#8217; which he repeats on each and every
occasion. This morning he said something about
somebody being as &#8216;queer as Dick&#8217;s hat-band;&#8217;
and when I asked him how queer that was he
answered, as quick as a flash, &#8216;Went half-way
round and tucked under.&#8217; He&#8217;s very original,
and ever so funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be; but his expressions on your
tongue are not funny, but silly. Why cannot you
pattern after Miss Joanna? You hear only good
English from her careful lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Natural depravity, Motherkin. But I&#8217;ll try.
I think myself that Dollowayisms do not sound
as well on &#8216;Humpty-Dump&#8217;s&#8217; lips as they do on the
&#8216;original Jacob&#8217;s.&#8217; There it goes again! Mother,
what does make me so thoughtless?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearie, I wish I knew!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find out! And I&#8217;ll conquer myself if&mdash;I
can! I will, dear Mother, if you will keep
faith in me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My faith in you will only fail with my life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
darling. You must have faith in yourself, and
not settle down to the belief that you cannot
make yourself all that you would be. But&mdash;a
truce to lectures for to-night! I want to hear
what Roland has to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went into the &#8220;peace-room&#8221; again, and
Beatrice placed her little brother beside herself
on the rug before the fire &#8220;to dry off,&#8221; while
Mrs. Beckwith roused Roland from his writing
to tell them all about his new venture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Mr. Brook told me that there
was no stage running from this place to Newburgh.
There are two, or more, which do go from
the town below us to the city above, but just here
there is nothing of the kind. He proposed that I
start a little &#8216;express route,&#8217; fetching and delivering
parcels for the New Windsorites,&mdash;those who
either have no horses of their own, or do not care
to trouble to drive regularly into the city. He
will speak to several persons for me, and even a
few families would be a good beginning. He says
I can probably buy a small covered cart at the
salesroom in Newburgh, second-hand, but adapted
to my purpose; and that it will not hurt Nan to
do the work. He proposes my making the trips
three times a week at first, while I am busy getting
in my crops&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;Hear! hear!&#8221; interrupted Bonny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then later on I can go every day if it seems
to be profitable. He also suggests that I begin
right away, and offers to go into town with me
and help me select my vehicle, if you approve.
Mr. Dolloway says it will ruin me; that I&#8217;ve
&#8216;undertook more&#8217;n a common man&#8217;d lay out ter
do, anyhow;&#8217; but I assured the old gentleman
that I did not consider myself a &#8216;common man&#8217;
by any means, but that I was my mother&#8217;s son
and meant to be worthy of my parentage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Motherkin, that flattery is intended to wheedle
the price of the &#8216;express wagon&#8217; out of your
pocket!&#8221; cried Beatrice, again, divining at once
the thought of her mother&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>Not that &#8220;wheedling&#8221; had any connection with
the anxiety of the widow, but that she reflected,
with grave doubts of its wisdom, how deeply she
was dipping into their small sinking fund. She
looked up smilingly, but asked seriously enough,
&#8220;How much will that cost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From thirty to forty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take you many days to get back that
much money, even if the experiment proves a
success. The houses are very scattered, and most
of the people about us either very wealthy or very
poor,&mdash;mill-workers and farm-employees, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
Brook told me. How can either class need such
service?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roland&#8217;s countenance fell. He felt the wide
difference between the caution of maturity and the
impulse of youth, and already foresaw that he
would be obliged to relinquish his plan, for the
want of that &#8220;paltry sum.&#8221; But he hated to give
up, and offered a suggestion: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure, since he
proposed it, that Mr. Brook will lend me the
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith&#8217;s answer was swift and decided:
&#8220;Dismiss that notion at once. With my consent
my children shall never run into debt. What we
have of our own, what we can earn, that we may
use; but the moment we begin to use other people&#8217;s
funds, that moment we not only sacrifice our own
dignity but our freedom. Mr. Brook is a rich
man. I do not doubt that he would give you
outright the cart you wish; but you must be as
honorable as he. Poverty need make no difference
that way, thank God. We have sometimes
gone pretty hungry, but we have never owed anybody
yet. If you think I seem niggardly about
the little left of our &#8216;insurance money,&#8217; it is because
I dare not reduce our rainy-day stock by any
further great amount. However, I will myself see
Mr. Brook in the morning and talk the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
over with him. I have no desire to be over-prudent,
but there are some questions I should like
to ask. Now, Beatrice, if you are &#8216;dried,&#8217; please
open the piano. It is high time a band of toilers
went to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devotions of the little family were very
simple, and the mother always led them. It was
mostly a service of song, and sent each heart away
into the silence of the night the better and happier
for its sweetness. This time, despite the
resolution that it should not last long, it was prolonged,
indeed, until brought to a sudden terminus
by Robert going to sleep in an upright position at
his mother&#8217;s elbow, and losing his balance, falling
headlong against the piano keys with a discordant
crash!</p>

<p>&#8220;Finale! Positively the last appearance, and
therefore the last accident, for the day of &#8216;Mr.
Humpty-Dump&#8217;!&#8221; cried Roland, and unceremoniously
picked up his small brother and started
stairwards with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t asleep! Sleep &#8217;self! Lemme &#8217;lone!
I want&mdash;I want a bee&mdash;a chick&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;h-e-n&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In five minutes the little fellow was in his own
cosey &#8220;nest,&#8221; unconscious how he arrived there,
and dreaming of a poultry-house full of downy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
chickens helping him to eat honey from a broken
custard-cup.</p>

<p>The last to fall asleep that night under the
old-time roof was Isabelle. Long after the
others were at rest she sat by the uncurtained
window of her &#8220;studio,&#8221; watching the clouds in
the sky, and feeling anything but happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the others are so busy, and all are earning
their own money except me! Oh! nobody
knows how hard it is! To give up everything I
liked and bury myself alive in a horrid country
town, which isn&#8217;t even a village, but a collection
of scattered tenements, with people living
in them who never call upon their neighbors,
except, of course, the Brooks. But they ought
to be kind; they enticed us here! Though I
did think this morning it all was going to be
better and easier; to-night I&#8217;m utterly discouraged.
If it weren&#8217;t for breaking my mother&#8217;s
heart, I&#8217;d run away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Isabelle! She had been the &#8220;show
pupil&#8221; of her class, and the real talent she did
possess had been magnified by injudicious praise
into what was &#8220;genius&#8221; in her own estimation.
She had been the only one who had disliked the
country project, and she found her trials even
greater than she had anticipated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>Presently, by dwelling upon the dark side of
her lot, she had worked herself up into a most
unenviable state of mind, and had thrown herself
dramatically upon the floor to sob her grief away.
But after a while she became conscious of some
noise outside the building, and timidity very
promptly banished melodrama.</p>

<p>She sat up and strained her ears to hear.</p>

<p>Crunch! crunch! crunch!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;it&mdash;sounds&mdash;like&mdash;like&mdash;wheels!&#8221;
she murmured with chattering teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whack! bang!&#8221;</p>

<p>Surely that was a muttered imprecation which
she caught!</p>

<p>Thieves? Housebreakers?</p>

<p>She neither dared to move nor cry out; but
the five minutes she remained where she was
seemed to her a lifetime. At the end of that
space the echo of retreating footsteps was so plain
that she rallied her courage and ran into Bonny&#8217;s
room, crying: &#8220;Wake up! wake up! We&#8217;ve
been robbed! Burglars&mdash; Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, I&#8217;m sorry. I won&#8217;t do it again!&#8221;
responded Beatrice, sleepily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />


<small>ROBERT&#8217;S OCCUPATION GONE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was such an absurd answer that Isabelle
laughed. In the laughter much of her fear,
and all of her anger against her sister, vanished.
With the quick rebound of her loving nature she
clasped her arms about the neck of the sleepy
Beatrice and kissed her heartily.</p>

<p>The disturbed secretary sat up and demanded:
&#8220;What is the matter, eh? Oh, I remember.
Well, I&#8217;m sorry, Belle. It was horrid of me,
though I didn&#8217;t intend to do it. I&#8217;d make you
some more custards if Mother would let me;
but I suppose she would say we could not afford
so much luxury twice in the same week.&#8221;</p>

<p>It does not matter what the elder girl replied.
The reconciliation was complete, and once more
two young hearts were beating high with aspirations
after better things, although, it must be
confessed, Bonny&#8217;s ideas were rather vaguely
exalted, owing to her drowsiness; but Belle was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
keenly self-reproachful, and exclaimed earnestly:
&#8220;I wonder why we never learn to be what we
mean to be. It seems as if life were one long
season of acting hatefully and trying to make
amends. Why can&#8217;t we be good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it up.&#8221; Yawn. &#8220;And, dearie, I&#8217;m so
sleepy I don&#8217;t know what to do with myself.
Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not go to sleep, I expect we have been
robbed of everything we possess!&#8221; As the recollection
returned to her of the real cause for her
present visit, Isabelle felt her timidity also return,
and, shaking her sister to keep that drowsy one&#8217;s
eyes open till she could tell the whole story, repeated
what she had already tried twice to make
the somnolent secretary comprehend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es. H&#8217;m-m!&#8221; Yawn. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re&mdash;all&mdash;right,
aren&#8217;t&mdash;we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand? Won&#8217;t you understand?
We have been robbed! B-u-r-g-l-a-r-s!&#8221;
cried the other, spelling the terrible word letter
by letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. I used to&mdash;spell it&mdash;l-e-r-s.
I spelled&mdash;&#8216;Coleoptera&#8217;&mdash;with a K;
and Mr. Brook nearly had a spasm. I&mdash;I&mdash;won&#8217;t
do it again, I promise you.&#8221; Yawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness! She&#8217;s asleep already! I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
believe she will remember one single thing of this
in the morning. I wonder if I ought to tell
Mother! But Roland is the one, I suppose;
only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought entered the girl&#8217;s mind, what if
she told nobody, but kept her knowledge to
herself and watched for more evidence before she
aroused the weary sleepers? Wouldn&#8217;t that be
the more unselfish way? And if she were really
in earnest about trying to be as noble as her
mother desired, was not unselfishness a bottom
principle, and might she not begin then as well
as later?</p>

<p>She answered her own questioning by casting
one more smiling glance upon the sleeper before
her, and, by the light of the shaded lamp, which
was always kept burning in the central hall from
which all their bedrooms opened, making her way
noiselessly back to her own apartment.</p>

<p>There she listened critically; but all was silent
without, save for the peaceful sounds of insects in
the trees and the plashing of the river at the foot
of the bluff. Then she carefully dressed herself
and sat down to await developments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! Nothing does happen, after all!
And how cold it seems sitting about alone in the
night-time! I&mdash;I believe I&#8217;ll just creep inside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
bed covers and watch there! It would be safer
as regards taking cold, and fan more comfortable!&#8221;</p>

<p>Deluded girl! As she crept into bed in her
full, every-day attire, and the strength of her
brave resolution, she put herself deliberately in
temptation&#8217;s way. Nature revenged herself, and
in less than three minutes the burglar watcher
was as sound asleep as Beatrice across the hall.
When she was aroused again the sunlight of
another day shone through her little skylight, and
Bonny was shouting from below stairs: &#8220;Hurrah!
hurrah! Isabelle! Is-a-belle! Wake up and come
down! Glory&mdash;magnificence&mdash;Hurry! No
matter about clothes! Come!&#8221;</p>



<p>Next an onrush of small limbs up the winding
staircase, and Robert bounded into the room to
precipitate himself headlong upon his sister&#8217;s bed.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come, Belle? Here we&#8217;ve all been
yelling at you like ever&#8217;thing! They&#8217;s&mdash; My
jimminy, Belle! Do you go to bed with your
clothes on? I bet, if my mother knew that,
she&#8217;d punish you! Eh? What&#8217;s the matter?
What makes you stare so?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;Clothes? Why, is it morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it morning? I should say it&#8217;s most noon!
An&#8217; a wagon&mdash; But I won&#8217;t tell. Only&mdash;
Mother! Belle went to bed in her clothes, an&#8217;
they&#8217;re all wrinkly up!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_232.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Why, folks! What&#8217;s all this?</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go downstairs at once, Robert!&#8221; commanded
the sister as sternly as she could, and dragged herself
to the window. But from that side of the
house nothing unusual was to be seen, and, beginning
to think over her last night&#8217;s fright, she
smiled at her own plight. &#8220;Mother will be sure
to ask why I did this, and my freshly ironed gown
is sadly tumbled, after all. Humph! I wonder if
I dreamed the whole thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, after a hasty toilet and
freshening of her garb, she descended to the lower
floor only to find it deserted and the whole family
congregated on the west side of the house, gazing
with surprise and perplexity upon a shining
&#8220;express wagon&#8221; which stood there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, folks! what&#8217;s all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what we wish to find out,&#8221;
returned Mrs. Beckwith, turning a very smiling
face toward her belated daughter. &#8220;Some fairies
must have been at work here during the night,
and we cannot guess who they are. Rather, we
may guess, but I do not feel at all sure. See!
isn&#8217;t it really handsome?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no mistaking that the vehicle was
intended for one of them; for on the brand-new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
curtains which covered its sides was plainly
painted, &#8220;Parcel Express,&#8221; and on the box of the
wagon, at the back, a modest legend: &#8220;Beckwith,
The Lindens, New Windsor, N. Y.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s from the Brooks,&#8221; asserted
Isabelle, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Beatrice, her
feet beating a restless tattoo to her joyful thoughts,
&#8220;because here is a note pinned to the cushion of the
seat.&#8221; And she tossed the other the paper, which
each of the family had scrutinized in turn.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;To whom it may concern: This cart is for the young
farmer. It does not come from either Mr. or Miss
Brook, but from another well-wisher, who hopes it will
be accepted in the same spirit with which it is offered.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">A Friend.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A friend, I should think so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it queer that none of us heard it brought
here?&#8221; asked Roland, whose eyes were shining
even more dazzlingly than the varnish of the
&#8220;express&#8221; in the sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;But one of us did; I heard it,&#8221; said Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And didn&#8217;t tell us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was burglars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burglars! Pshaw! If you&#8217;d only looked
out you might be able to tell who rolled the thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
here. I can&#8217;t wait to know to whom I am
indebted, to thank him or her. Mother, are you
sure it isn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly sure; besides, my son, you have
asked me that question already a half-dozen times,
and each time I have answered that I knew no
more about the matter than you do. I wish I
did; I don&#8217;t quite like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Motherkin! Of course you will let us
keep it! I know what you are thinking; but if
my Laureate has enough sense to be willing to
drive an &#8216;Express Parcel&#8217; or a &#8216;Parcel Express&#8217;
for the good of the house of Beckwith, I hope you
won&#8217;t put rocks in his road!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is from somebody who knew how much I
wanted it; that is plain. It <i>must</i> be from the
Brooks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dears; I do not think they would stoop
to a falsehood even to confer a kindness. At
least, if they would, I am disappointed in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, wull, ain&#8217;t we never goin&#8217; ter eat our
breakfasses?&#8221; demanded Robert, suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, indeed. For work-a-day folks we
are very late. But, Isabelle, what is this about
your sleeping in your clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother, it seems awfully silly to
tell!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>&#8220;No secrets in this household, Belle!&#8221; cautioned
Bonny.</p>

<p>Thus adjured, the whole story came out, and it
was many a long day before Isabelle heard the
last of her going to bed to watch burglars.</p>

<p>Everybody would turn her or his chair at table
so that the new possession was in sight, and their
tongues wagged so continually that the meal was
long protracted; and before it was through Mr.
Dolloway had come across fields to pay his regular
morning call. He had an unexpressed opinion
that the &#8220;new family&#8221; would come to griefs indescribable
if he did not keep a protecting guard
over them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoity, toity! What&#8217;s this? What&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;world
is this? Must be getting millionaires
over here!&#8221; exclaimed the old man, in
apparently intense surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Mr. Dolloway! Do <i>you</i> know anything
about it?&#8221; cried Bonny, running to the window
and leaning eagerly out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw the thing in my life before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t? Then away goes my last idea!
Of course, if either Mr. or Miss Brook had given
it, you would have known!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolloway did not comment upon this opinion.
He merely began to walk about the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
vehicle and examine it with the eye of a connoisseur
in express wagons. &#8220;H&#8217;m-m! &#8217;Pears to be
purty well put together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well put together!&#8221; exclaimed Roland, joining
their visitor. &#8220;It&#8217;s perfect. Whoever picked
it out knew what was what!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I should like to know what you, a
city feller, know about wagons!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I never owned one I have seen them
by the thousands, yes, the millions, I suppose;
and I know this looks exactly like those the dry-goods&#8217;
houses send out. And the one at the last
store I worked in might have been first cousin to
the &#8216;Beckwith.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! Sounds kind of top-lofty, don&#8217;t it?
You, a little, ign&#8217;runt sprat, a comin&#8217; into a town
an&#8217; a settin&#8217; up a business that never was set up
there afore!&#8221;</p>

<p>Roland was in too good humor to resent the
unpleasant candor of his old neighbor, so he
merely whistled a bar from the &#8220;Mikado,&#8221; and
went on to call Mr. Dolloway&#8217;s attention to the
various merits of his new possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Hain&#8217;t hitched her up yet, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but I will, right away. Unless&mdash;
Mother, is there anything I can do for you before
I go to work?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;Nothing, thank you, my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roland thereupon turned stableward, and his
old friend walked with him, smiling grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you don&#8217;t never forget to ask that
question, do ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not often. I don&#8217;t like to let my mother do
any lifting if I can help it, and now that Bonny
is away so much she might if I didn&#8217;t look after
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! That&#8217;s right. An&#8217; I reckon you&#8217;re
a purty level-headed kind of a chap, after all, if I
do take you to do now and again; yes, yes, I
do. So you hain&#8217;t <i>no</i> notion who gave you the
wagon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, no. Though, despite the
neatly written note which declares to the contrary,
and my mother&#8217;s faith in its assertion, I
think it must be one or other of the kindly
Brooks. You see we know nobody else hereabout
who would trouble to be kind to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, diddle diddle! You don&#8217;t, hey? Well,
I guess them folks hain&#8217;t got a monopoly of all
the goodness there is in the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds as if you resented my thinking
it was a gift from them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I do, lad, I do. I hain&#8217;t a claimin&#8217; no
superiority to your ma&#8217;s jedgment when I say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
that she is old enough to look further than one
family afore she gives up findin&#8217; out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we mustn&#8217;t quarrel over it, anyway.
Somebody, I do not know who, has been very,
very generous to us; and I am too grateful and
happy to question very deeply into the matter
now. It is sure to come out, sooner or later. So
I think, and I shall watch as sharply as I can for
indications of the giver. Hello, Nan! You&#8217;re
in luck to-day! You&#8217;re to try a brand-new
business!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a loud houp-la! and Robert had
joined them. &#8220;Say, Mr. Dolloway! Don&#8217;t you
s&#8217;pose my chickens &#8217;ill be out to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose anything of the sort.
But I am so everlasting tired of hearing about
them that I fetched you over a brood already
hatched out. What do ye say to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gol&mdash;I mean&mdash;hurra! Did you? Honest
Injun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t give to makin&#8217; no statements I don&#8217;t
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the place for chickens, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>Off bounded the delighted lad, but half-way to
the poultry-house turned and ran back again.
&#8220;Will you come with me, Mr. Dolloway?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! Well, I guess I&#8217;ll get you taught
some kind of manners if I keep on, I really do.
In course I&#8217;ll come, an&#8217; show you how to tend
&#8217;em. But I&#8217;ll tell you, first off, I hain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to
have any tomfoolery with &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I dunno what you mean!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Robert, so honestly that the
old man believed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may not know <i>now</i>, you may have forgot;
but you knowed yest&#8217;day. What was you
a-doin&#8217; with a fish-line in the hen-house, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t your hen-house! I mean&mdash;that&#8217;s
sassy, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, ha!&#8221; chuckled the veteran. &#8220;Got
caught, hain&#8217;t ye? S&#8217;posin&#8217; I tell your ma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I&#8217;d jest as soon tell her myself,
only I forgot it. I will, the first time I remember.
Anyhow, it didn&#8217;t do no harm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Mr. Dolloway?&#8221; asked the widow,
who made it a point herself to visit the poultry-house
immediately after breakfast and see that the
fowls were properly fed, and who now joined them
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Motherkin! I&mdash;yest&#8217;day&mdash;I&mdash; Wull,
it didn&#8217;t do no harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t so easy as you thought, eh, Bubby?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;Easy &#8217;nough. Yest&#8217;day I had some fun with
the hens; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of fun, Robert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, I had a fish-line, an&#8217; you wouldn&#8217;t
lemme fish, not fer fish; so I fished fer hens,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fished&mdash;for&mdash;hens!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. My cracky! you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; died a laughin&#8217;!
I put the hook through a kernel of corn and
throwed it to &#8217;em, and they&#8217;d gobble at it like
anything! Then I&#8217;d pull &#8217;em in; but it mostly
came out of their mouths before I landed &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Beckwith! I can scarcely believe my
own ears! How <i>do</i> you learn such cruelty?
It must be born in you, though, for you certainly
never copied it from your elder brother. In all
his life I never knew Roland to wilfully hurt
a creature of any kind; but you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Motherkin! You wouldn&#8217;t scold your
dear little boy fer a little thing like that, would
you? It didn&#8217;t hurt the hens, not a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! It didn&#8217;t hurt the hens; but why,
you shaver?&#8221; demanded Mr. Dolloway, who
greatly enjoyed his small tormentor&#8217;s predicament,
yet who really was growing very fond
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause a man&mdash;he come an&#8217; told me to stop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
But I had some more fun &#8217;at he didn&#8217;t get onto,
afterwards!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckwith sighed and dropped upon a
bench. There were times when her &#8220;dear little
boy&#8221; tried her very soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else did you do?&#8221; demanded Mr. Dolloway,
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A boy come along an&#8217; I asked him in. That&#8217;s
p&#8217;lite, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, you are to invite no visitors without
my knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, I won&#8217;t again, then. But you hadn&#8217;t
told me, er I&#8217;d forgot. An&#8217; he showed me how
to put &#8217;em to sleep. You just take a hen er a
chicken an&#8217; put its head under its wing fer it, an&#8217;
shake it up lively&mdash;side to side, like, a keepin&#8217;
its head tight under&mdash;an&#8217; you can stan&#8217; &#8217;em up
in reg&#8217;lar rows. When I get a lot I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
make &#8217;em play soldier, that way. Soldiers asleep,
though, they&#8217;d be, wouldn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind with any of
my hens an&#8217; chickens!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Dolloway,
hotly, and picking up the basket which contained
the family of fluffy little creatures he had brought
for a gift, he started toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Dolloway! I&#8217;ll be good! I&#8217;ll
be as good as I can be! Won&#8217;t you leave &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>Mrs. Beckwith knew how one feels to have
a gift returned upon one&#8217;s hands, and she quietly
interposed: &#8220;Yes, Mr. Dolloway, please consider
the matter for a moment. I assure you that I
had no idea my boy was torturing the poor
creatures committed to his charge, and I have
always overlooked their feeding for myself. But,
after hearing what I have just now, only one
course is left to me. I now take the poultry
away from Robert altogether. He will be allowed
no further connection with this business; but if
you can trust <i>me</i> with your pretty present, I will
do my best to rear the chickens safely. Until a
boy learns the first simple rule of &#8216;doing as he
would be done by,&#8217; he is unfit for any post of
honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is spoke like a lady, as I always found
you, Mrs. Beckwith; an&#8217; I think myself &#8217;at Bobby
is too young to be let have sech full swing, an&#8217;
it&#8217;ll do me proud to leave the brood to you.&#8221;
Saying which, the kind, if gruff old fellow bowed
profoundly to the lady, but cast a withering glance
upon his worsted foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, Mother! do you mean it? Ain&#8217;t I
no hen-keeper no more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear; and it is your own fault that
this is so.&#8221;</p>

<small>ROBERT&#8217;S HAPPY GUESS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;ONLY six weeks at The Lindens and I feel
as if it had been home forever!&#8221; cried
Bonny, returning from her day of service in Mr.
Brook&#8217;s study. &#8220;The old life in that Second
Avenue flat seems like a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the result of your busy life, my dear;
and I am most sincerely thankful that our venture
here does not really lose its charm for us, as
time passes. We are all happier than Isabelle,
though; and I regret her feeling more than I can
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s trying ever so hard to be contented,
Motherkin, and I hoped she was succeeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will succeed. No honest effort ever failed
of a certain success. She may never be as happy
here as we are, however, for her nature is different.
She craves luxuries and refinements
which we could do without. I wish I could control
them for her!&#8221; And Mrs. Beckwith sighed
gently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;Now, dearie, don&#8217;t go for to yearn for the
moon. Be satisfied that so many of your brood
are doing well, and maybe Isabelle will work out
her own contentment some way. Oh! before I
forget it and get bee-stung to the exclusion of
other thoughts, Miss Joanna is to give a dinner-party
to-morrow. She handed me the invitation
for you and Belle yesterday, and I didn&#8217;t think to
take it out of my pocket last night. You see, the
bees were swarming, and that was all I wanted to
do then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear! and I suppose she expected an
acceptance or the reverse this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I assured her you would come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had no right to do that, for I cannot
avail myself of her kindness to this extent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many reasons why not. I do not wish her to
feel any compulsion in social matters, regarding
us. We are not rich people, and all of the Brooks&#8217;
guests are. Our especial host and hostess would
doubtless enjoy our coming, as they always seem
to do, but I should not enjoy putting myself upon
a false standing. My self-respect would not permit;
though I will write a note at once, and one
of you must take it across fields to Miss Brook.&#8221;
Mrs. Beckwith rose as she spoke, and Beatrice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
hastened to clasp her mother&#8217;s waist with restraining
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Motherkin, I haven&#8217;t finished my
story; I had only begun. You know it takes
forty times as many words for me to tell a thing
in as for anybody else. Miss Joanna foresaw just
this behavior on your part, Motherkin darling,
so she was forearmed. She says she shall take it
as positively unneighborly if you do not come.
She wishes you to meet these &#8216;old families,&#8217; folks
who have been aristocrats so long that they have
forgotten how to be snobbish, if they ever knew.
You will enjoy them, and they you. Our friends
were very, very emphatic in their urgency. But
that isn&#8217;t all; she wanted to know if I thought
Isabelle would come over to-morrow early, and
arrange her rooms for her. She says she has
watched Belle, and everything she touches takes on
a different look from what anybody else can give it.
Of course, the old furniture is not to be disturbed.
Miss Brook would as soon think of laying aside
her own gray gown as banishing one stick of that
venerable, upholstered stuff. But it&#8217;s flowers and
things; some new pictures, and&mdash;Motherkin! such
a surprise! I&#8217;m not going to tell you&mdash;not even
Miss Brook knows&mdash;but I hope with all the hope
that is in me that my sister will not refuse to go.&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Certainly she will not refuse to do so simple
a neighborly act for Miss Brook. The dining
there is another matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; if she&#8217;ll only go the first time, in
the morning, that is all I ask. The rest will follow;
it is positively certain. Will you ask her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But are you going to the bees before
supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must. This is the time of greatest need
for watching. Yet I&#8217;m tired! Hard work isn&#8217;t
all fun, is it, Motherkin? and I&#8217;ve worked awfully
hard to-day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More busily than usual?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so. Good Mr. Brook does get so
interested in his catalogue, and he is apparently
so delighted with my superior merits as a secretary,
that he forgets himself and would keep me
writing right along till midnight, I believe, if
it weren&#8217;t for dear Miss Joanna or interfering
Mr. Dolloway. By the way, Mother, something
is wrong with that man. He&#8217;s offended with
the Beckwiths, root and branch. I fancied it
was only his normal condition to be so &#8216;all-fired&#8217;
cross, but Mr. Brook informed me that he was
suffering from a worse attack than common. He
also hinted that we were responsible for it, and
mentioned unappreciated kindness.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;Why, Beatrice! I thought we had tried to
express our gratitude continually. He is, in
truth, very kind, though sometimes a bit officious,
it seems to me. I do not suffer from this
officiousness personally, but it annoys the others,
especially Roland. The lad is trying so hard and
is growing so manly and reliable that I can&#8217;t
bear to have him fretted. However, I will try to
be even more particular in future to express our
obligation. If you are going among the hives
now, call Robert to go with you. He is out of
doors somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert called himself, though, for he appeared
at the open doorway with a very red face and an
excited manner. &#8220;At it again, Bon! Hurry up
an&#8217; get your bee clothes on! I&#8217;ve got mine here!
I do hope they ain&#8217;t a goin&#8217; to swarm on top of
no more trees, anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you liked the danger of climbing
to the top, Lieutenant!&#8221; returned Bonny, hastily
donning her veil and gloves, and taking her long-handled
net in her hand.</p>

<p>Robert also put on his protectors, in his haste
getting the hat wrong side to the fore, and trying
to wear the thumb of his glove on the back of
his hand; but such trifling irregularities as these
were nothing to him, and he followed his sister
hastily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;Alas! They aren&#8217;t going to light! And
we&#8217;ve nothing to do but walk around after them
and await their good pleasure!&#8221; cried Bonny, in
disgust, after a half-hour&#8217;s loss of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! I hate bees, anyway! An&#8217; I guess I&#8217;ll
give up the business!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Humpty-Dumpty&#8217;! Leave poor Bonny all
alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, wull, a body can&#8217;t work hisself to
death, can he? Here I have to go ridin&#8217; round
all every other day with the &#8217;spress wagon.
Roland thinks he can&#8217;t get nothin&#8217; done if I don&#8217;t
go to hold the horse an&#8217; pick up parcels, an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;ll
quit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! your own self. You couldn&#8217;t be hired
to let that cart go out of the grounds without
your small highness perched up in front. And if
I had nothing to do but drive around the country
three times a week and a little studying on the
off days, I should think I was a lucky boy.
Besides&mdash; There they go! Up with you! Softly,
now! Oh dear! I wish I could climb as
fast as you, and had as great a gift with bugs
and things!&#8221; cried the sister, enviously.</p>

<p>Robert paused half-way up the trunk of the
tree he was ascending, and cast an inquiring
glance Bonnyward, but, seeing that she was really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
sincere in her admiration, he condescended to
proceed on his way. At last, in the &#8220;bee business&#8221;
there did appear to be a fitting field for
the restless boy&#8217;s energy. Thus far he had been
very faithful to his part of the work, the watching
over the apiary&mdash;as they called their few
hives of bees&mdash;during Beatrice&#8217;s absence at Mr.
Brook&#8217;s; and the lesson he had learned by having
his poultry taken away from him seemed fruitful
of good results.</p>

<p>It was an hour later that the two young
apiarists entered the dining-room and sat down
to the delayed supper for which their appetites
had been ready long before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Motherkin! Strawberries? Where did
you get them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gift, my dears! I saved them till you two
came in, that we might eat them all together.
Another gift from the generous, gruff Mr. Dolloway.
He offered them in the oddest way. Said
he had been to Newburgh to order some things
for Miss Joanna, which could not be left for
Roland&#8217;s trip to-morrow, and saw these early
berries in the market. He &#8216;didn&#8217;t know why we
shouldn&#8217;t eat strawberries early in the season as
well as anybody else!&#8217; and more to the same
point. I wish I knew what was the matter with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
him, and he must indeed be very fond of some
of us, if he continues to lavish kindnesses upon
us, even while he believes he has reason to be
offended. The strange, poor old man!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had none of them perceived a face looking
in at the open window, for the lighted lamp
upon their table left them illuminated while causing
the world outside the window to remain in
darkness; but, finally, a scraping Ahem! brought
every glance about, and Robert paused with a
spoonful of berries half raised toward his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Who&#8217;s there? Oh! Dolloway&mdash;Mr.
Dolloway, I mean&mdash;what you doin&#8217; scarin&#8217; folks
that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hearin&#8217; my neighbors&#8217; honest opinion of
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence, which Mrs. Beckwith
broke by saying gently: &#8220;You could not
have heard anything inimical to you, Mr. Dolloway,
though you must have learned our perplexity.
Please come in, and share the feast you
have so generously provided us. But, what is far
more my desire, please explain frankly in what we
have hurt your feelings or seemed ungrateful for
all your neighborliness. Will you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old servant&mdash;for such he considered himself
still, though he was treated quite as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
equal by nearly all who knew him&mdash;rarely refused
a request of Mrs. Beckwith. He had come
intending to sit an hour in that cheery &#8220;peace-room,&#8221;
and though he had been momentarily
angered by hearing himself the subject of discussion,
he now swallowed his pique and entered.</p>

<p>Robert jumped down from the table and ran
with a dish of the fragrant fruit to the visitor,
but was waved grimly away. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t give
things an&#8217; then come an&#8217; eat &#8217;em up.&#8221; Nor could
any persuasions prevail upon him to change his
mind.</p>

<p>In almost any other household the situation
would have been highly uncomfortable; for, as
Belle fancied, Mr. Dolloway sat jealously watching
every morsel vanish, and looking as if he had
conferred an everlasting obligation upon them
all; but they were too really sincere in their liking
for the odd old man and too busily occupied
with their own interests to pay really much
attention to this.</p>

<p>Suddenly the guest demanded, &#8220;Goin&#8217; parcellin&#8217;
to-morrow, young man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I expect to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m! Like the wagon, I s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do like it very much. It is perfect for my
business, so light and yet so strong; and the canvas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
cover makes such a good shelter from rain in
case of these sudden showers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m-m!&#8221; said Mr. Dolloway, gruffly, &#8220;h&#8217;m-m!&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert, having devoured all that he could find,
now concluded that he was satisfied with his supper,
and leaving his place crossed over to the
lounge and perched himself beside Mr. Dolloway.
&#8220;Say, I bet <i>you</i> know who give us that wagon!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old fellow fairly jumped. &#8220;What&#8217;s that
you say? What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I just bet a sixpence you know who
give it to us! I&mdash;Ginger! I&mdash;Mr. Dolloway&mdash;didn&#8217;t
<i>you</i> do it yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>One could certainly have heard a pin drop, in
the silence which succeeded this question. Then
the guest cried sharply, &#8220;What makes you so
much quicker witted than the rest o&#8217; your
folks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dolloway! Is it possible? Has Robert
really guessed the truth?&#8221; asked Roland, hurrying
to the old man&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to say. I hain&#8217;t a single
thing to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just yes or no? Please, just yes or no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, s&#8217;posin&#8217; I do. What better off will you
all be then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This much better, that we shall at length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
have a chance to thank the real donor. I have
tried again and again to make Mr. Brook acknowledge
that he was our benefactor, but in that
respect he has as steadily denied the charge. But
he, too, has intimated that we ought to know who
had been good to us. And&mdash;I never thought of
you! I&mdash; <i>Is</i> it you, Mr. Dolloway?&#8221;</p>

<p>Queer old man! All the anger and gruffness
disappeared from his manner instantly. His
spare face softened and grew genial, his eyes
beamed, his smile became cheery. Still, not until
Robert had climbed upon his lap and with eager
arms clasped about his neck had declared positively,
&#8220;I know it&#8217;s you just the same&#8217;s if I saw
you, you can&#8217;t fool me any longer!&#8221; did the
truth out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I thought it was a pity, seein&#8217; you
young folks so smart and ambitious, that you
didn&#8217;t have more of a lift. I know it ain&#8217;t my
master&#8217;s way to give things outright. He says
folks don&#8217;t gen&#8217;ally like it; but if I give I give,
an&#8217; that&#8217;s all they is to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, dear Mr. Dolloway, why did you so mislead
us? You said you had never seen that
wagon before you came over here the morning
when we found it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I told you the gospel truth. I never had.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>&#8220;But you did give it to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;s&#8217;pose I did, seein&#8217; as you ask me
square.&#8221;</p>

<p>The delayed thanks were now offered with
double earnestness, and each word of gratitude
was balm to the wounded spirit of the lonely old
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you think it queer o&#8217; me, ma&#8217;am, to
have showed so much feelin&#8217; &#8217;bout a trifle like
that. But I don&#8217;t lay no claim to perfection.
I like to give things, but&mdash;I like to be thanked
for &#8217;em when I do. I s&#8217;pose that&#8217;s carnal human
natur&#8217;, but it&#8217;s the truth. An&#8217; I did enjoy the
surprise of you all, a plaguy sight; but when
you got to thinkin&#8217;, an&#8217; nothin&#8217; didn&#8217;t seem to
alter the notion &#8217;at nobody &#8217;ceptin&#8217; Mr. Brook or
his sister could do a generous action, I was mad.
I ain&#8217;t nobody but a servin&#8217;-man, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t
make no pretence. But I am what I am, in the
right place, or the Lord wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; put me there.
An&#8217; &#8217;cause I am a servant don&#8217;t hender my givin&#8217;
a present, now and again, if I want to, does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In one way&mdash;no. But, my dear sir, I feel
as if this were too rich a gift. You may have
let your generosity silence your prudence. Ought
you to do so much for us? I hope you understand
I mean this just as gratefully.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>&#8220;I do understand you, ma&#8217;am. An&#8217; I will
say that I never met a lady as was as considerate
of the feelin&#8217;s of others as you be. Not even
exceptin&#8217; Miss Brook, as is a lady every inch of
her. But you needn&#8217;t worry about the cost of
that wagon. It didn&#8217;t take but one month&#8217;s
wages to pay for it. A pity I couldn&#8217;t do that
much for old Mr. Conrad&#8217;s sake. Though he was
young Mr. Conrad when I knew him; and many&#8217;s
the bout we all have had together,&mdash;Master and
him an&#8217; me. &#8216;Waive formality for once,&#8217; Master&#8217;d
say; an&#8217; down we&#8217;d sit to as big a dinner
as the city of New York could furnish. You see
fellows that was Forty-Niners together did get a
little mixed up as to who was boss and who wasn&#8217;t
when they got to talkin&#8217; over old times. Nothin&#8217;
like a &#8216;Vigilance Committee&#8217; to take the nonsense
out o&#8217; folks, I tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once started on his Californian reminiscences,
experience had taught them that Mr. Dolloway
rarely left the theme till actually forced to do so;
and Bonny, foreseeing an extra dose of &#8220;California&#8221;
coming now, interrupted the discussion
promptly. &#8220;Who did buy the wagon if you
did not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Brook, Mr. Brook himself. I didn&#8217;t
like to trust his judgment in the matter, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
had to. I had the rheumatiz that day, an&#8217; he was
goin&#8217; into town, so he selected it. Then the wagon-makers
fixed it up fresh and sent it down. It
was a brand-new one, though. It wasn&#8217;t none
of your &#8216;second hands.&#8217; Was you a-thinkin&#8217; it
was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did not think so for a minute. We knew
it must be a new one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; business is fa&#8217;rly successful, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is splendid. I am earning about
three dollars a trip now, clear profit; and I think
I shall do still better later in the season, when
more of the city people get out here to their
country homes. You see, I flatter myself that
I know how to do an errand well. I try to be
exact, and I know&mdash;of two things&mdash;which seems
the newer or better. I owe that to my late city
training. Yes, I shall build up a really profitable
business, soon. Then I sell already a good many
early vegetables. I have sold all of one crop of
pease, and have the second one coming on. It is
&#8216;the early bird catches the worm&#8217; in the green-grocer
or market-gardener business, in truth.
By and by, when the people get their own gardens
growing, my stock may have to go begging
for a purchaser.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Then I suppose you&#8217;ll let us have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
at least a smell of the pease-pods!&#8221; exclaimed
Bonny, laughing. &#8220;So far, I assure you, Mr.
Dolloway, the enjoyment <i>we</i> have had in our
&#8216;early vegetables&#8217; has been the satisfaction of
seeing them grow. But I have been more generous.
I have given the family enough honey to
make each member of it sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which was a long look ahead, my friend!
Because the family appetite is now cloyed, and
honey may be left safely anywhere about without
fear of its diminishing in quantity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolloway laughed as heartily as the others,
and, having stayed long enough to &#8220;beat that
young whipper-snapper of a Robert terribly&#8221;
over a game of checkers, departed homeward, in
high good humor with himself and all the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;How funny! If I had given anybody a surprise
gift I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d be angry if it proved
the surprise!&#8221; exclaimed Roland, as he closed the
windows for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure, my son. Almost everybody
likes to be thanked for kindnesses conferred,
and Mr. Dolloway is an old man, to whom all
events are now great ones. The thing which
worries me is his using his money, he a wage-earner
himself, for us. It doesn&#8217;t seem right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that, Motherkin. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
heard Mr. Brook say that his &#8216;man&#8217; has several
thousand dollars in the bank. You see he gets
forty dollars a month, and his &#8216;keep.&#8217; Besides
that he has his clothing given him, and he has
no relatives of whom he knows. I think my employer
told me these facts, in view of our feeling
just this way about the wagon. It really will not
hurt Mr. Dolloway to use some of his money, for
they will always take care of him, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it must rest as it is for the present.
Only let each be carefully polite and attentive to
the poor old fellow, that he may fully understand
we do appreciate our obligations to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Motherkin. But there&#8217;s somebody else
who, I fancy, is deserving of some gratitude,&mdash;Mr.
&#8216;Humpty-Dumpty&#8217;! But for his brightness we
should still be at odds with our humble patron!
All in favor of thanking the Lieutenant of the
Bee Squad, say, Aye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye!&#8221; &#8220;Aye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, really, thank you, my little boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it!&#8221; returned Robert, with a
complete imitation of grown-ups and with his own
inimitable little swagger.</p>

<p>Whereupon everybody laughed again, and
Bonny moved the piano-stool into place for her
mother&#8217;s use.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>&#8220;Belle, I always like to have something nice to
go to sleep on,&mdash;to think of, I mean, the last
thing at night; so I want you to hear. You are
to go over to Miss Brook&#8217;s in the morning; and
you are going to be the very proudest, most
delighted young woman in Orange County!&#8221;</p>

<p>So cried Bonny, tiptoeing into her sister&#8217;s room
late that night, and rousing that tired maiden
from her first nap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Beatrice! I was asleep. Haven&#8217;t you
been in bed yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I was doing some bee sums. If one
hive of bees&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I protest!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If all the other members of the family are
happy bread-winners and money-getters, why
shouldn&#8217;t the &#8216;belle&#8217; of the family be one, too?
Answer to that conundrum in the morning at the
residence of Miss Joanna Brook, spinster.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br />


<small>WISTARIA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WHAT a fine, substantial, aristocratic-looking
old place it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Isabelle&#8217;s thoughts, as she moved slowly up the
long driveway to the Brook mansion, were almost
envious. She had come across fields to fulfil the
neighborly office which Miss Joanna had begged,
and she had attached little importance to Bonny&#8217;s
prophecy of a &#8220;delightful surprise&#8221; awaiting her.</p>

<p>Indeed, what would have made Beatrice extravagantly
happy would have scarcely appealed to
Isabelle at all. The elder girl was fighting valiantly
to &#8220;down discontent,&#8221; but so far her efforts
had not been crowned with marked success. To
accept the simple life which God had ordered for
her was a bitter trial. She was not the first who
has imagined it would &#8220;be easy to do just right
if&mdash;&#8221; in some other way one could arrange
one&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t I have been born in such a
home? Why need my mother toil as she does?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
And Roland, Bonny, even little Bob, has to think
each day how best to increase the family income;
while these old people, at the very end of life,
have ten thousand times more than they can
use or enjoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a &#8220;fine old place,&#8221; rich with the
accumulations of nearly a century of ownership
by the same, always wealthy family. It stood
&#8220;four square to all the winds that blew,&#8221; its back
and front so exactly alike that it could not be
said to put its &#8220;finest to the world.&#8221; On either
end, immense fluted columns rose to the roof,
which, extending over the wide veranda thus
formed, gave protection to those who would enjoy
these &#8220;out-of-door rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The east veranda looked toward the river, the
west upon the tree-lined avenue which led from
the road, a quarter of a mile distant, through
the park to the mansion. On either side, also,
were gay parterres of choicest flowers, while a
&#8220;maze&#8221; of old-time box borders invited the
curious to tread its quaintly constructed paths for
a full mile of windings in and out, before one
could emerge on the northern side, and upon a
well-kept bridle-road, which led through the great
forest on the bluff, down its sides to the river, the
old &#8220;embankments&#8221; and the well-preserved historic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
reminders of a day when the Chidly Brooks
&#8220;had fought and bled for freedom&#8217;s cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stables and outbuildings were well to the
south of the mansion, and on that side were also
the kitchen offices, which in this well-ordered
establishment were as freely open to inspection as
any other part of Miss Joanna&#8217;s &#8220;kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! my dear! It is good of you to come so
early! That is exactly what I like: plenty of
time to do things neatly and completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, dear Miss Brook! you are so quick and
active I should think you would not ever take
much time for anything! You are certainly
twice as spry as I am!&#8221; responded Isabelle, surprised
from her revery by the salutation of her
white-haired neighbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that! I don&#8217;t know
about that! I do know that the only way of
making haste which I understand is to take such
thought beforehand that I rarely make one blundering
movement. I have never had time, even
in my long life, to &#8216;hurry,&#8217; but I have managed
to accomplish about all I have set out to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I do try to &#8216;hurry,&#8217; but never succeed!
I am slow-motioned&mdash;a dreamer, my mother tells
me; and once in a while I get so behind-hand
that I put on steam and then&mdash;a smash up!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>&#8220;Give it up, my child, give it up at once.
Learn to use forethought instead of haste and
you&#8217;ll be thankful all your life for doing so.
But, dearie me! how old lips do love to preach,
and how distasteful it is to young ears to listen!
No, no, my child. I do not think you are impatient.
It is only that I remember so distinctly
how I disliked to learn of anybody in this world&mdash;except
Joanna Brook! But come in, come
in. I have as many of these May roses as I
think we can use. The others we will cut after
these are in place. Did you ever see this earth
more lovely than it is this very morning? Oh,
what a God! what a loving, generous God!&#8221;</p>

<p>Isabelle looked up swiftly into the sweet old
face before her. She was sometimes startled
by these sudden outbursts of feeling on Miss
Joanna&#8217;s part; a person who ordinarily never
&#8220;preached,&#8221; but who seemed so full to overflowing
of the love of God that her natural speech
became, at times, as the speech of an alien.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose He is,&#8221; answered the girl, slowly.</p>

<p>Miss Brook darted a glance into the beautiful
face of the girl, and opened her lips quickly; but
the words she would have said she altered to the
quiet remark: &#8220;If you do not know, but only
&#8216;suppose,&#8217; you will know some day. You would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
know now if it were His will. But come in.
Let us begin at the front parlor first.&#8221;</p>

<p>They ascended the steps and entered the great
hall, which ran through the main floor of the
house from back to front. Each entrance door
stood widely open, and the outlook either way
was entrancing. Isabelle forgot to be regretful
for her own privations in the enjoyment of that
scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;How lovely! This would make such a pretty
picture, if one might put it on canvas. This
great hall, with the curious staircase, the old-time
furniture, and that big, hospitable vista beyond!
May I sketch it sometime, Miss Joanna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed! And we would feel honored.
Ah! those old outside galleries,&mdash;galleries we
called them, when I was young,&mdash;many&#8217;s the
cotillon has been danced upon them, many the
tea-party gathered there. See this table! It is
a century and a half old. It is only about
four feet in diameter, yet eighteen people have
gathered about that bit of mahogany to drink
a cup of tea, when tea was tea, my dear!
These are the cups; they were my grandmother&#8217;s.
See?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady stepped to a cabinet and took out
a tiny cup and saucer of delicate china, thin as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
an egg-shell and no larger than the smaller end
of one. &#8220;I often sit and muse over those old
times. I can imagine the whole scene so well,
and sometimes I almost find myself talking gossip
with the dead-and-gone dames who drank to
the success of &#8216;the army&#8217; in these same bits of
cups. I must show you my grandmother&#8217;s gowns
and things some day, my dear; I think you
would enjoy seeing them, even trying them on,
if you like. Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>A moment&#8217;s thought flashed through Isabelle&#8217;s
brain. Here were artistic possibilities open to her
that the city could not have furnished, and her
discontent vanished entirely. &#8220;I should be
very grateful, dear Miss Brook! It would be a
treasure-trove to me! But sometime, after I
have worked very, very faithfully to do better
things than I ever have accomplished, will you
sit to me for a sketch? It sounds like the
greatest presumption, yet would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would I? Would I not? I should be delighted!
Make a trial right away, to-morrow
if you can. I should love to give a new picture
of myself to Chidly. The last one I had painted
was when I was middle-aged, in &#8216;my prime&#8217;
some flatterers said, &#8216;neither hay nor grass,&#8217; <i>I</i>
said. I had outgrown the dimples of youth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
I had not acquired the finish of age. I&#8217;m in my
prime now, I fancy, as near as I ever shall be
until God sends Azrael to lay the touch of perfect
peace upon my restless lips.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_266.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">There was no answer, and Miss Joanna turned<br />
about swiftly.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>She led the way without another word into the
wide eastern drawing-room, and threw open the
shutters to let in the morning sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are, my child, free to do exactly as
you please. Make the rooms as pretty as you
can, and I begin with this first, because it is chief.
You can call for one of the men to cut as many
flowers as you like. The bushes and trees are
loaded with blossoms now. And, oh! here is
something you will like, at least I hope so. A
gift from the daughter of a dear old friend, herself
as noble a woman as ever drew breath
though she couldn&#8217;t help be that, with such a
mother! The girl&mdash;dear me! she&#8217;s fifty, if a
day, but a girl to me always!&mdash;this girl is
manager of one of the art rooms in the city, and
she brought me this for a birthday gift from there.
Isn&#8217;t it pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer, and Miss Joanna turned
about swiftly. She was a woman who liked
others to share her enthusiasms.</p>

<p>Isabelle was straining with clasped hands and
parted lips, gazing amazedly upon a threefold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
screen shielding the hearthplace. The panels
bore each a female figure, but the central one was
that which had engrossed the young artist&#8217;s attention
to the exclusion of the others; and its design
was a golden-haired child in a delicate drapery of
heliotrope tint reaching upward to pull the bunches
of wistaria blooms from a vine wreathed above
her head. The scheme of the coloring, even to
the framing of the screen, was of heliotrope and
gold, and the effect was of indescribable light and
joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I see you like it! We think it is beautiful,
beautiful! and my friend says that though
they do not know the artist&#8217;s name now, the Art
Directors will make every effort to hunt her up
and help her on; for I suppose it must be a
woman, since this is a Women&#8217;s Society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Isabelle did not speak, her words seemed
utterly to have deserted her; but there was one
at hand who was never at a loss for language, and
with a rush and whirl Beatrice came waltzing into
the great room, her eyes dancing as gayly as her
feet, and her lips bubbling over with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer! I
thought I should just burst with impatience, so
I told Mr. Brook he would have to excuse me a
minute, whether or no, and here I am! Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
Miss Isabelle Beckwith, what have you to say for
yourself? Didn&#8217;t I have a surprise for you,
and isn&#8217;t it just too glorious to be true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t believe it! Even yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should like to know what has come
over you two children!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Joanna,
utterly at sea for an explanation of this odd
behavior.</p>

<p>Bonny stopped dancing, went up to her sister,
threw her arms impulsively about Isabelle&#8217;s neck,
and kissed her heartily. Then she asked, &#8220;Shall
I tell her, or will you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle blushed a little, but her eyes shone with
pride as she turned toward Miss Brook. &#8220;Since
I have heard your opinion of the panel when you
did not know who painted it, I suppose I may tell
you that your words made me very proud. That
&#8216;Wistaria&#8217; is my own work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness! Is it possible! And to think
that I never dreamed it! Yet why should I?
The only signature anywhere about the picture is
a blade of grass in one corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Isabelle, now as gay as she had
been speechless before, &#8220;that was the only one I
dared use. I am such a mere beginner in art,
that I feel as if I really know nothing yet!
Only I feel it within me&mdash;strong, strong, strong!&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
I shall sometime be able to put a little of
myself, my dreams and ambitions, into visible
form! Oh! I am so grateful and so humble.
I am ready now, dear Miss Joanna, to say with
you, &#8216;God is so loving, so generous!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence in the room for a moment,
during which Bonny&#8217;s dark eyes filled with an
unwonted moisture; and rather than &#8220;sprinkle
down the occasion&#8221; she stole quietly away and
to her own duty in that big study, where natural
history and she had such a tussle daily to understand
each other, but where a growing friendship
had been established between them under
the wise instruction of Philipse Chidly Brook,
Esquire.</p>

<p>Beatrice&#8217;s departure broke the spell, and Miss
Joanna moved swiftly forward and clasped the
trembling, success-humbled Isabelle in her kindly
arms. &#8220;Ah! my dear, if you can take your
good fortune in such guise, all things will be possible
to you. I envy you; yes, even if it is
wicked! The feeling in your heart at this moment
must be so exquisite! To be conscious of one&#8217;s
own power to transcribe a little of this wonderful
beauty all about us so that other eyes may read
its secret too, and to be assured that the dear
God is approving by helping one as He has helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
you now, must be happiness indeed! My darling,
I congratulate you with all my heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle looked up with glistening eyes. Where
was now the envy that had tormented her soul
as she had approached that house but a few
moments before? Gone utterly. For ten times
the wealth and pride of all the Brooks who ever
lived in those stately old rooms she would not
have given up one iota of the pure joy which
now thrilled her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear lady, a bit of a while ago it was I who
was envious. Now I wouldn&#8217;t change places
with you for the world! But, dear me! how
horrid that sounds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no. Let it stand! You are like a
young queen who has known all along that her
blood was royal, but whom the world has not
acknowledged. Now you are free to enter into
your kingdom. In the name of the people, welcome!
See to it, crowned one, that you always,
as now, reverence your high estate!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Joanna kissed the girl gently on her
white brow, then moved quietly away; and Isabelle
looked after her wonderingly. &#8220;I did not
dream that she had all that romance and fine
feeling in her alert, practical nature! Well, I
shall know a new Miss Joanna now, and love her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
dearly, dearly! But I came over here to work,
not to dream; and though I am so glad I can
hardly keep still, I will do, exactly as Motherkin
would bid me, &#8216;the task that lies nearest the
best that I can.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Certainly no rooms were ever arranged with
more loving delicacy of touch and judgment than
were these old parlors for Miss Brook&#8217;s dinner-party;
and when all was finished and Isabelle
free at length to go home, she approached her
old friend with something of timidity in her air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Joanna, may I speak with you a
moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour, if you will. It would take all that
to express my pleasure in everything, yourself
included, if I were to try to put it into words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then will you understand me exactly, when
I say, something, maybe queer&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, we have taken a peep each into the
other&#8217;s soul this morning. I am certain there
will be no misunderstanding. You may say all
you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even wise Miss Brook was not wholly prepared
for what was forthcoming, though secretly
rejoiced at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, all of us, except myself,
have some way of earning money; there does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
seem to be anything especial I can do, unless&mdash;
This arranging your rooms has put an idea into
my head. Do you think some of the other rich
families about here, the &#8216;summer folks&#8217; and all,
would give me an opportunity to help them get
ready for their social gatherings, as I have done
for you? I want, this is what you must certainly
understand, I want to always fix your things if
you will let me, because it is the only way I
can show&mdash; No, that isn&#8217;t it! Because I love
you! You have from the first seemed to like
me, and I have been so glad of it. Bonny is so
bright, and Roland so manly and good, and little
Bob so&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The least said about little Bob the better!&#8221;
cried the old lady, smiling so brightly that Isabelle
was quite reassured. &#8220;We all love the
little scamp who teases the patience out of us
a dozen times a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But for these other people, if I&mdash;who do
understand the value of beautiful things, even if
I don&#8217;t own them&mdash;could take care of their bric-&agrave;-brac,
put their apartments in order after the
maids have done their sweepings, and as I imagine
few servants are trained to do, at a small price
per hour, I should be very glad to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Brook put on her spectacles and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
fixedly at her young neighbor. &#8220;My dear, they
said you were the proud one of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you realize what you are asking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly. It will be putting myself in a
servant&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancied you were even a little ashamed to
have your brother drive the &#8216;Parcel Express.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ashamed of everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I am only ashamed of myself, ashamed
of the ignoble shame I felt then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the artist in you? Will you not be
coining money by that talent soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not. Those who do the best work
are the least appreciated for a while. It has been
so in so many lives of real artists. No, indeed,
I am not dazzled by the sale of one panel!
&#8216;One swallow doesn&#8217;t make a summer.&#8217; And
if I can earn money in some other way, I can&mdash;I
can keep my soul clean. I need never earn
&#8216;pot-boilers&#8217; by a desecration of what little power
I possess, but I can always keep that channel
to expand in. Does that sound very presumptuous
and conceited in me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds as I wish thousands of other
workers felt. We should have truer pictures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
finer statues, loftier literature, if the greed for
money were kept out of the question. You are
right. Roland is right. If he is a poet, he will
not be debarred his privilege to sing because he
ploughs the field or drives the &#8216;Parcel Express.&#8217;
If you are an artist, you will work out your beautiful
conception none the less because you have to
live in industry, not idleness. My child, I shall
always call upon you to help me gratuitously;
but you shall help my neighbors at the rate of
thirty cents an hour! Do I understand you,
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Isabelle gave a quick, warm embrace to the
kind creature beside her, and, her task being done,
escaped before she betrayed herself into any more
sentiment.</p>

<p>It was a very different girl who bounded homewards
over the sun-dried grass than she who had
moved wearily, almost despondently, along the
regular paths a few hours before, and her heart
rejoiced at sight of her mother&#8217;s face watching
for her from the kitchen door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! the dear Motherkin! I can hardly wait
to tell her. She will be as glad, almost more
glad than I!&#8221;</p>

<p>But what is that? At first sight of her daughter&#8217;s
form approaching The Lindens, Mrs. Beckwith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
had hurried forward, waving a strip of paper
above her head. She seemed quite as excited and
eager as Isabelle herself; and as soon as they had
come within hailing distance, two shouts crossed
each other on the sun-lighted air.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter, good news, good news! A check&mdash;for
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Motherkin! I was never so happy in
my life!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.<br />


<small>THREE YEARS LATER.&mdash;THE RESULT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THREE years have passed since Isabelle ran
gayly over the fields to greet her mother
and to receive the first money she had ever earned
in her life.</p>

<p>The little check made out in her mother&#8217;s name
for &#8220;the unknown painter of the Wistaria panel&#8221;
had been used to supply its possessor with an
assortment of the best dusters, brushes, and
chamois appliances for the care of bric-&agrave;-brac and
articles of virtu, and the balance had been expended
in colors and canvases.</p>

<p>Miss Joanna had been as good as her word.
The dinner-party had been a complete success,
with Mrs. Beckwith and her elder daughter
among the guests, and with no end of admiring
phrases concerning the graceful decorations of
the old house falling upon the decorator&#8217;s grateful
ears. Whereupon Miss Brook had started the
ball rolling in a quiet way, and within a few
days Isabelle had already been called upon three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
times to &#8220;help&#8221; some distracted hostess prepare
for a social entertainment.</p>

<p>Those who called upon her once, invariably did
so the second time; and before the end of her
&#8220;first season,&#8221; as Bonny teasingly called her
sister&#8217;s early experiments, Miss Beckwith had become
the fashion, but, fortunately, a &#8220;fashion&#8221;
so thoroughly useful and agreeable that she was
destined to outlive the common existence of
&#8220;fads&#8221; and to be looked upon as a necessity in
New Windsor festivities.</p>

<p>Now three years had slipped away. &#8220;Almost
imperceptibly, isn&#8217;t it, Motherkin? We have
been, we always are, so busy that it doesn&#8217;t seem
any time from one spring to another;&#8221; and there
was to be a little dinner-party at The Lindens
itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The list of guests is a short one, but big
enough to cover our dearest friends, after all;
and that&#8217;s all a body, a work-a-day body, wants
of any company. If we hadn&#8217;t &#8216;waived formality
for once&#8217; and invited Mr. Dolloway to
dine with his &#8216;betters,&#8217; we should have had an
odd number at table, and if there&#8217;s anything I
dislike it is a lop-sided table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Beatrice! No trespassing on my preserves!
I am the judge of what a table should be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
and if our third guest had proved as &#8216;contrary&#8217;
as I fully expected, I was going to crown my
eighth chair with laurel and set it up to the
&#8216;Success of The Lindens and the Family Industry!&#8217;
However, I&#8217;d rather see a happy
human face at the table&#8217;s foot than any laurel
wreath; and there they all come!&#8221; As she
spoke, Isabelle gave a satisfied glance about the
&#8220;peace-room,&#8221; and the banquet therein prepared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you&#8217;re proud, Belle! Every
dish of which we shall partake has been prepared
by your own fingers, as well as almost all the
lovely things in this room, except, of course,
my masterpiece of honey. The Bees, the Lieutenant,
and your Humble Servant claim credit
for that golden pyramid! Ah, yes, and the
Eggs, and the Chickens, and the Boned Turkey,&mdash;these
are the Motherkin&#8217;s! But all the rest&mdash;
They&#8217;re at the door, dear! Come and receive
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arm in arm the sisters passed to the wide
porch, and stood there smiling welcome upon the
three aged figures which came slowly up the
driveway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ha, my dears! That&#8217;s what I like! A
welcome at the open door! That&#8217;s hearty and
old-fashioned, and as it should be. Between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
friends, my dears, between friends. Of course, in
a stately assemblage one must do as custom dictates.
And may I be allowed to pay you both a
bit of a compliment on this happy occasion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allowed or not, brother Chidly, you are certain
to pay it; but they&#8217;ll bear it. They&#8217;ll bear it
without spoiling by it,&#8221; said Miss Joanna, gayly.
&#8220;Once in a way it does no harm to tell a girl
she&#8217;s pretty, when the beauty is offset, as in
our dear ones here, by such good common-sense.
Three years, is it? Three days it almost seems
to me! Time goes so fast when one is old;
though I&#8217;m not really old yet, am I? Nor
Chidly here, nor Dolloway, who consented, at
last, to sit down to our feast with us. Ah! here&#8217;s
the Mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Beckwith&mdash;one had to
look twice to be sure that this round, plump
matron was really the once fragile Mrs. Beckwith&mdash;appeared
to add her welcome to her daughters&#8217;.
She leaned proudly, as any mother might,
upon the arm of a tall, broad-shouldered youth of
twenty, whose upper lip had just become interesting
to himself and an unfailing source of
amusement to Mistress Beatrice! But the air of
real manliness, the honest courage and determination
of the bright eyes under the heavy brows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
told of a character strong enough to afford an
occasional weakness, even to suspecting a mustache
where mustache there was none.</p>

<p>On the mother&#8217;s other side walked Robert, for
once separated from the rifle which had been his
latest gift from the adoring Mr. Dolloway, who
declared again and again&mdash;and nobody had the
heart to contradict him&mdash;that if it had not been
for that now historic &#8220;spanking,&#8221; administered
upon the occasion of his first meeting with
&#8220;Humpty-Dumpty,&#8221; a valuable citizen would
have been lost to the world.</p>

<p>Did &#8220;Bob&#8221; resent this? Not a bit. He had
long since learned to look upon his old comrade
as the most delightful, generous, indulgent person
in existence; and he now forsook his mother to
clap Mr. Dolloway upon the shoulder, exclaiming:
&#8220;Say, Partner! Why didn&#8217;t you take that
honey out of that hive last night? If we&#8217;re
going to let you share in the business, you
mustn&#8217;t expect to shirk, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert! that is impertinent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t mean it that way. Partner
knows. But he told me to go off and practise
shooting at that sardine box on the lane gate-post
and he&#8217;d tend to the honey things for Bon. But
he didn&#8217;t, and <i>I</i> got the lecture &#8217;stead of <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; retorts &#8220;the partner,&#8221; &#8220;I had to
watch the way you scored, didn&#8217;t I? If I hadn&#8217;t
you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; claimed more&#8217;n I had myself! I wasn&#8217;t
going to allow that, you may believe!&#8221;</p>

<p>The others exchanged smiles. If there was any
among the group who showed signs of that second
childhood which is given to great age, it was gruff,
kindly, honest old John. He did not feel, he
rarely appeared, any older than his young and constant
companion. He still &#8220;served&#8221; Mr. Brook,
but would have been dumfounded had that generous
old &#8220;master&#8221; actually requested any service;
and it was a saying in the neighborhood that
&#8220;Dolloway owned the whole Brook household.&#8221;
Which was not quite true; though this is true, that
Mr. Chidly and Miss Joanna, feeling profoundly
grateful for the wonderful vitality and soundness
of intellect with which a good God and right living
had blessed their own old age, felt also a
parental interest and care over the more restricted
powers of this venerable, faithful friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bees! I haven&#8217;t seen the apiary for a
week!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Brook. &#8220;If it will not
delay our hostess, let us visit that before the busy
workers have retired for the night. I am never
tired, never, of watching these tiny creatures, nor of
learning from them. By the way, Beatrice, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
little article of yours on &#8216;The Mechanism of the
Bee&#8217;s Sting&#8217; has just been published in the &#8216;Magazine
of Natural History&#8217; for this month. Did you
know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonny made a little grimace, and pointed
proudly toward the orderly city of hives, which
now really deserved the name of apiary, and
which had acquired a reputation throughout many
States, so that the &#8220;Beckwith&#8221; supplies of all
sorts of bee-stock were in good demand among the
markets; which was only the beginning of what
this ambitious girl of seventeen hoped to accomplish.
&#8220;For I will not stop, if I can possibly help
it, till I have earned and saved enough to give my
little brother a college education. The rest of us
have had to do without, but there&#8217;s no reason why
we shouldn&#8217;t have one scholar in the family!&#8221;</p>

<p>To which Robert listened with perfect complacency
and the reflection that if he did &#8220;go to college
he&#8217;d be the champion of the football team,
anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p>He bade fair to excel in anything athletic, certainly,
and, for Bonny&#8217;s sake, let us hope he will
in things scholastic. He did, indeed, stand at the
head of his class at the public school he attended,
and his mathematical powers were excellent. But,
at his age, there is no calculating with exactness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
what he may prove to be in the years to
come.</p>

<p>As they turned houseward again, after a close
inspection of the well-kept apiary, Mrs. Beckwith
slipped an arm about her younger daughter&#8217;s
waist. &#8220;What is this I hear, dearie? Have you
taken to writing for the press?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had, Motherkin, I should have had to tell
you at once. But it was this way: Mr. Brook is
kind enough to say I can put things quite clearly
on paper, with my little typewriter; and I happened
to please him with some notes I made. So
nothing would answer but I must write them out
more fully and let him send them to the magazine
he mentioned. Of course, they wouldn&#8217;t refuse
to publish anything <i>he</i> sent! So&mdash;that&#8217;s all
there is to that story! Therefore, little Madam,
don&#8217;t lay the flattering unction to your soul that
you are the parent of a literary creature. You
are not; only of a common-sense, happy, healthy,
hard-working little girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a close pressure of the hand, and
Mrs. Beckwith rejoined her guests. Talk about
queens! That little woman, with the soft gray
hair and the loving smile upon her lips, thought
that there was never a human being so rich and
so blessed as she.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>In five minutes more they were all seated at
the well-arranged table, the sight of which, Miss
Joanna declared, &#8220;would give even a dyspeptic an
appetite!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Brook&#8217;s eyes wandered about the apartment
curiously. &#8220;I never enter this room but I
find something new in it to admire. Joanna,
look behind you, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Brook wheeled swiftly about. What
Chidly discovered admirable was always doubly
so to his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chrysanthemum tapestry! The dream
embodied at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as her children wished, there hung upon
the wall beside the wide hearthplace, &#8220;where
somebody could appreciate it,&#8221; the vision Mrs.
Beckwith had seen in Mr. Brook&#8217;s basket of
chrysanthemums so long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Until to-day, a secret even from us, for whom
she wrought it all!&#8221; cried Isabelle, eagerly.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it beautiful? Isn&#8217;t it perfect?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Dolloway&#8217;s opinion had not yet been called
for; but he was &#8220;the privileged member&#8221; everywhere,
and he coolly left the table, putting on
his horn-bowed spectacles as he did so. &#8220;Well,
Master, I thought I was right, even without my
glasses! But I will say them is the best picters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
you an&#8217; Miss Brook has ever had took! Who
done &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who could do them, who could use a needle
so exquisitely, who in this world, but our own
blessed little mother?&#8221; answered Bonny, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;The needle! you don&#8217;t tell me them faces is
<i>sewed</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Every particle of the work is
done with a needle,&mdash;the needle of a genius! her
children think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I should think they might!&#8221; returned the
old man, fixing his eyes solemnly upon Mrs. Beckwith,
who had always had his highest veneration,
but who now seemed to have been suddenly lifted
off from the common earth and placed upon a
pedestal; and so overwhelmed in thought was
he that he began to eat his dinner without a
word, even one &#8220;reminiscence&#8221; of his beloved
&#8220;California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dears, are you all satisfied, quite
satisfied, with our experiment?&#8221; asked Mr. Brook,
as they finally grouped about the fireplace, preparatory
to saying good-night. &#8220;Three years must
have proved the wisdom of it, seems to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, it has, dear friend. We are all well,
happy, and I believe useful. Isabelle has, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
her domestic talents,&mdash;the very last she dreamed
that she possessed three years ago,&mdash;found
entrance into the households of the rich, and has
there learned that no amount of money can give
happiness. She has by a despised faculty been
enabled to cultivate her highest; and it is one of
the good things we have to tell you to-night, that
her last picture will be hung, &#8216;on its own
merits&#8217; <i>and on the line!</i> at the forthcoming exhibition
in the National Gallery. This coming
year she proposes to go into town regularly for
the instruction which she desires, and which her
&#8216;servant wages&#8217; will pay for. But, Roland, speak
for yourself. Mother does not wish to monopolize
the talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to tell, Motherkin, except
that I have had a few bits of verse accepted at
the <i>Criterion</i>, and am therefore satisfied that it
was a golden opportunity you offered me of
coming into the country and learning to be&mdash;a
man! And I am grateful for the hard work
which kept me from writing trash till I could
write some simple thing the people would care to
hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&mdash;I have got a hundred dollars in the
bank!&#8221; cried Robert &#8220;the mercenary,&#8221; at which
all laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;How about you, my Bonny? Do you regret
that the only chance you have to sing is in the
house of God and in your own home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; exclaimed Miss Joanna, &#8220;she cannot
regret that! For, if she did but know it, more
people come to church of a Sunday to hear her
rich young voice in her solos than to hear the
pastor&#8217;s sermon. The one last Sabbath was
heart-moving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The more shame to them, then! And to me
that I cannot do better. No, I regret nothing,
save my own limitations. But, like my sister, I
think I will also treat myself to a few lessons
this coming year, and try to do ever so much finer
work. Though I shall never sing any more
really&mdash;out of my heart and because I can&#8217;t help
it, you know&mdash;than I do now. Nor, if the chance
were offered me, which it won&#8217;t be, would I
exchange my life here for that of any <i>prima-donna</i>
living!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Preemer donners are awful rich, Bonny!&#8221;
admonished Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so are you, small sir, if you had sense
enough to believe it! So are we all, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amen!&#8221; said Miss Joanna, earnestly.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Beckwith quietly rose and struck a
few chords on the well-used instrument beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
her. There was a moment&#8217;s hush; then out
upon the gathering twilight floated the first
strains of the familiar Doxology.</p>

<p>Bonny led them, but the other voices followed
swiftly. Even the cracked, quavering tenor&mdash;that
once had been&mdash;of old John Dolloway
feared not to yield its tribute of sweet &#8220;Praise
God!&#8221; to Him who had been, who ever would
be, to each and all of them so close a Friend.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
